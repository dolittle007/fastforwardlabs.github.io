Tumblr\u2019s templates were more\ncustomizable than Facebook, making it a good place to put your portfolio,\nperhaps some journal entries. But the defining feature of Tumblr culture is\nreblogging: Any user can repost content from any other Tumblr and add their own\ncomments. All of these likes, reblogs, and comments pile up in a log of \u201cnotes\u201d\nappended to the original post as it travels through the network\u2019s feed.\nCelebrating someone else\u2019s brilliance is part of the content you offer, giving\nexposure to both the creator and the reblogger.</p><figure><img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/fe7f3635dc6eaaeccd097f24fd2400e0aee69189.gif?w=500\"></figure><p>To grow a following on Tumblr beyond people you know, you have to\npost more than updates on your personal life\u2014you need stuff that will resonate\nwith strangers. Viral fame on Tumblr in the early 2010s was an uncertain path\nto fortune. The most common was the Tumblr-to-book phenomenon: The creator of\n<a href=\"http://hipsterpuppies.tumblr.com/\">Hipster Puppies</a> closed a five-figure book deal in 2010. While other social\nnetworks like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn generated billions upon billions\nof dollars, Tumblr gradually evolved into a fast-moving conversation focused on\njokes, art, and sex. The culture of Tumblr began to be dominated by teens\u2014weird\nteens. </p><p>In <a href=\"http://only1600kids.tumblr.com/post/136758504394/creativereadingfanfiction-hiphopocliedes-a\">a joke that explains the dynamic</a>, a user posted a screenshot\nshowing he had 264 followers, writing:<span> </span></p><blockquote><p>a darkened auditorium with 264 silent people in the seats. on the\nstage, me, sitting on a stool, lit by a spotlight, the only light in the\ntheatre. i hold up a photo of my cat, 10 people applaud, two or three hold up\nphotocopies of the same photo, the rest do nothing, watching, waiting.</p></blockquote><p> <span>When I began reporting on the world of Tumblr teens, I first\nwanted to explain the absurdist comedy of Pizza and dozens of other Tumblrs\nlike hers.

I was there to\nmeet Danielle Strle, Tumblr\u2019s 34-year-old head of culture and trends, whose job\nit is to figure out what the teens are up to. At one point she opened her\nlaptop to scan for some examples and got lost in the content. \u201cThese kids are\nso advanced\u2014so, so advanced,\u201d she said softly to her screen. Not just in their\ncomedy, but in their business savvy. \u201cThey are the most brilliant digital\nstrategists,\u201d she said. \u201cThese teens are better marketers than anyone in the\ngame right now.\u201d </p><aside>\u201cThese teens are better marketers than anyone else in the game right now\u201d</aside><p>Tumblr teens have an advantage that makes them good at digital\nstrategy: an advanced emotional intelligence. Strle put me in touch with Jason\nWong, a college freshman who\u2019s been on the site since he was 15. He became my\nTumblr oracle, giving me in-depth analysis of the Tumblr economy and its\nemotional core. Wong started <a href=\"http://asian.tumblr.com/\">asian.tumblr.com</a> to deal with being bullied at his\nFlorida high school. Wong explained that teens perform joy on Instagram but\nconfess sadness on Tumblr. The site, he said, is a \u201csafe haven from their local\nfriends. \u2026 On Tumblr they tell their most personal stories. They share things\nthat they normally wouldn\u2019t share with their local friends because of the fear\nof judgment. That has held true for every person that I\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>In the dark ages\u2014the 1980s, \u201990s, or even the early 2000s\u2014kids\nhad to wait for nerd camp to be among their own kind.

This brand of Tumblr\nhumor often focuses on what I think of as micro-humiliations, tiny moments of\nsocial awkwardness that can feel absolutely crushing for a teenager figuring\nout how to be a person in the world. Anonymous kids with witty user names like\n<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/larsvontired\">Larsvontired</a> or <a href=\"http://baracknobama.tumblr.com/\">Baracknobama</a> post incisive one-liners confessing their most\nvulnerable moments of social mortification. Sometimes those one-liners spread\nacross continents, tweaked by thousands of other teens who add their own jokes\nas they reblog the original. The very best tweaks spread further, reblogged\nagain and again, reappearing periodically in the feed, disconnected from time.\nSome posts get more than a million notes\u2014imagine a joke whispered in biology\nclass getting a laugh from a city the size of San Francisco. </p><figure><img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/e7d813c9f46be14f3ea955be50e6d094f648f46f.png?w=800\"></figure><p>\u201cIncreasingly, the lingua franca is absurdist dada,\u201d explained\nStrle, usually rendered in the uncapitalized and unpunctuated casualness of\ninstant messages. </p><p>A decade of trend pieces has deemed millennials to be narcissists,\nbut Tumblr humor for this generation is self-deprecating and anti-aspirational:\n\u201c<a href=\"http://fuckyeahloldemort.tumblr.com/post/25017288012/a-ciddd-how-do-fourteen-year-olds-get-pregnant\">how do fourteen year olds get pregnant</a>, I can\u2019t even get a high five from a\nguy,\u201d \u201c<a href=\"http://hudlion.tumblr.com/post/85729627913/envycamacho-how-many-eye-contact-until-date\">how many eye contact until date</a>,\u201d \u201c<a href=\"http://thedailylaughs.tumblr.com/post/92725289218/kushangel-i-just-said-hi-to-someone-and-they\">i just said hi to someone and they\ndidn\u2019t hear me</a> i\u2019m never trying that again.\u201d There is more self-loathing than\nself-love (\u201c<a href=\"http://fasterfood.tumblr.com/post/62276742765/twerkingdead-looks-in-a-mirror-you-again\">*looks in a mirror* you again</a>\u201d) as well as pleas for clemency from\nsocial prison (\u201c<a href=\"http://officialfrenchtoast.tumblr.com/post/132123701463/darrynek-you-like-attention-how-dare-you\">you like attention? how dare you.</a> how dare anyone like being\nloved\u201d).

In 2011, they bought ROFLnow.com and created social media\naccounts, including a Tumblr, to promote the site. They soon realized their\nTumblr was performing better than the web site it was supposed to promote.</span></p><p>Lilley and Greenfield grew up with the internet as a toy,\ncompeting with friends to make the most viral video, pranking adults at a strip\nmall within walking distance of their homes in Reading, Pennsylvania, when they\nweren\u2019t old enough to drive. Lilley\u2019s first YouTube hit was posting the audio\nof President Obama calling Kanye West a jackass for interrupting Taylor Swift\nat the 2009 Video Music Awards. Lilley read me the video\u2019s YouTube description\nout loud\u2014\u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7KMdAaaOy8\">Obama Calls Kanye West a Jackass [ACTUAL AUDIO]</a>.

When he posted\nthe video he was 15, and it currently has more than 177,000 views.</p><p>Some kids found out about the YouTube channel at school and not\neveryone was nice about it, so they kept their Tumblr project secret. But the\nfirst time it made more than $50 in a day with a banner ad from Google AdSense,\nthey realized Tumblr could be a thing. ROFLnow.com never made more than $20 in\na day; Lilley made about $80 a week working at a diner. </p><p>Lilley and Greenfield launched So-Relatable on Tumblr in late\nFebruary 2012. \u201cRelatable\u201d has a slightly different meaning on the teen\ninternet than in the adult world, and even its purveyors struggle to describe\nit. Lilley called it \u201ca thought, feeling or idea that resonates with others.\u201d\nBased on my years of immersion, I\u2019d say it\u2019s more about revealing\nvulnerabilities. \u201cTumblr is a really safe space to make these observations out\nin the public where everyone can see but no one knows it\u2019s you,\u201d Strle told me\nwhen I visited Tumblr. I saw this in the quiet rage at how your social status\ncan be determined by patently stupid actions, like <a href=\"http://amandla.tumblr.com/post/59794351333/getsby-ur-bra-strap-is-showing-u-say\">the grave consequences for\nthe tiniest infractions in high school</a>:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cur bra strap is showing\u201d u say </p><p>children begin to scream </p><p>tears r streaming down my face </p><p>my parents disown me and sell me to a shady, moustached man for\nthree goats </p><p>no one can ever kno i wear a bra</p></blockquote><p> Lilley and Greenfield didn\u2019t coin the term \u201crelatable,\u201d but they\nmade it popular, helping to solidify its internet meaning. A Google Images\nsearch of \u201crelatable\u201d turns up hundreds of their posts, plus many by imitators,\neven though the blog So-Relatable has disappeared, like Pizza, from the\ninternet.

In\nOctober, they filed as an S-corporation, So Relatable Inc., and split the\nshares 50-50. </p><p>Soon, Lilley and Greenfield told me, they were getting 15 million\npage views a month. They had more than 450,000 followers on So-Relatable and\nwere growing several other blogs. It was an enormous reach for two teenagers\nfrom a Rust Belt town of 88,000 people, and they did it by tapping into the\nessence of what makes content shareable: Here Is A Feeling You Thought Only You\nFelt But Is Actually Universal.</p><figure><img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/858aaf66f184d70a5e007f314e5ca2ef68a0e7f8.gif?w=500\"></figure><p>I spent the day with them in Greenfield\u2019s parents\u2019 basement this\nfall. The walls were bright red, and we lounged on an overstuffed wraparound\ncouch. I\u2019d expected to watch them work, but they had enough posts queued up to\nlast the day, so instead we just hung out, which, just like so many hangouts\nwhen I was their age, eventually devolved into watching videos online. Except\nthese videos were ones they made as kids. I set up my phone to record our\nconversation, resting it on top of a can of dog food belonging to Greenfield\u2019s\nfluffy Pomeranian, Pebbles. \u201cGive me all the gossip,\u201d I commanded. Instead,\nthey gave me the secrets to virality.</p><p>Lilley is tall and lanky, with dark brown curly hair. Greenfield\nis shorter, with glasses and honey-brown hair. They both wore plain polo\nshirts. Summer had just ended, and there was a pool in the backyard, but they\nwere quite pale. After studying their mannerisms and hearing Lilley\u2019s repeated\nallusions to Greenfield\u2019s math skills and superior memory\u2014he was briefly a\nmechatronics engineering major\u2014I determined they were nerds. They were witty\nand warm and very smart, and I liked them immediately, but they were total\nnerds. It surprised me, because nerds are often defined by an inability to read\nsocial interactions and respond in a way that makes them cool, confident\u2014<i>relatable</i>.\nSo I gently asked Greenfield how he was able to make these minute social\nobservations that hinge on complex emotions being expressed in subtle facial\nexpressions when, perhaps, this was not his strong suit in real life. His\nanswer: internet research. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t relate to a lot of the things I was posting about, but\nlike, you read online that a lot of people were going through that, so I was\nlike \u2018Oh I guess that\u2019s a relatable thing,\u2019\u2009\u201d Greenfield said. He didn\u2019t\nunderstand why someone might be nervous in front of the police for no reason.\nHe didn\u2019t understand complaints about substitute teachers\u2014those were \u201cjokes\nthat I blatantly wouldn\u2019t get.\u201d But if an unfamiliar feeling was mentioned\noften enough online, Greenfield would write about it. </p><figure><img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/c85f6d93eda3c99a57bbe36d28c62e08d4abbccc.png?w=800\"></figure><p>Researching their way to relatable played out most interestingly\nin one demographic: girls. As of last fall, only 10 percent of internet users\nuse Tumblr, according to the Pew Research Center, but 23 percent of teen girls\ndo, compared with 5 percent of teen boys. At one point, Lilley and Greenfield\nnoticed, 65 percent of the So-Relatable readership was female. Greenfield\nconfessed he\u2019d written many posts from a girl\u2019s point of view, posts he didn\u2019t\nrelate to, and, when he got flustered as I repeatedly demanded specifics,\nLilley interrupted: \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a period.\u201d Period posts do really well.\nLilley showed me a post about a girl asking a friend to check her pants in the\nbathroom. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously something we\u2019ve never said to each other.\u201d</p><p>Lilley and Greenfield had figured out an array of tricks both\nobvious and not, some technical, some thematic. They found text converted into\nan image performed better when the second sentence was the longest; a post with\na high ratio of notes to comments was a sign a community cared deeply about a\nsubject; typos weren\u2019t always bad, because you have to share a Facebook post to\ncomment on it, and people shared typo-marred posts to make fun of the mistake.\nLilley and Greenfield interacted with followers as well. When they posted a\nrecipe for a snack on another of their blogs, Lifehackable, readers would\ncomment with photos of their version, and Lifehackable would reblog them.</p><p>I\u2019d seen a few Lifehackable posts years ago and assumed they were\nsatire. \u201cLife hacks\u201d are simple tips to make your life a bit better in the\ntiniest ways, the kind of tricks that are so obvious you can\u2019t believe you\nweren\u2019t already doing them\u2014finding the best deals on eBay by searching for\nmisspelled listings, keeping power cords neat with hair clips, making \u201ctime\nbomb soda\u201d by freezing Mentos in ice cubes. (Applicability of the life hack\noften depends on one\u2019s lifestyle.) Lilley and Greenfield had partnered with a\nguy they\u2019d known for years, Tom, to run Lifehackable. Tom was not good at it.\nHis life hacks were less hacks than poor life choices. In one notorious post,\nhe suggested that you could make a \u201cpersonal ice cream bowl\u201d by cutting a pint\ncontainer in half vertically. The post went viral when another user commented\n\u201c<a href=\"http://totheinternetandbeyond.tumblr.com/post/58393506360/richardsherman-or-or-or-you-could-just-take-off\">OR YOU COULD JUST TAKE OFF THE FUCKING LID YOU INBRED</a>.\u201d</p><p>The outrage clicks were so powerful, Lilley and Greenfield decided\nto experiment with \u201cnegative attention.\u201d Haters are more loyal than fans, so\nthey promoted the bad hacks. The worst hacks brought in thousands of followers,\nand that\u2019s how Lifehackable built the bulk of its audience. \u201cTom knew what was\nhappening, and so then he was more incentivized to actually not do his job\nright,\u201d Lilley said. \u201cAnd in sucking, he succeeded.\u201d</p></div></div><figure>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/858aaf66f184d70a5e007f314e5ca2ef68a0e7f8.gif?w=200&amp;fm=gif\">\n                                            <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/858aaf66f184d70a5e007f314e5ca2ef68a0e7f8.gif?w=200&amp;fm=gif\">\n                                            <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/858aaf66f184d70a5e007f314e5ca2ef68a0e7f8.gif?w=200&amp;fm=gif\">\n                                            <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/858aaf66f184d70a5e007f314e5ca2ef68a0e7f8.gif?w=200&amp;fm=gif\">\n                                            <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/858aaf66f184d70a5e007f314e5ca2ef68a0e7f8.gif?w=200&amp;fm=gif\">\n                                            <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/858aaf66f184d70a5e007f314e5ca2ef68a0e7f8.gif?w=200&amp;fm=gif\">\n                                        </div></figure><div><div><figure></figure><p>At Tumblr headquarters, I found myself in a contest of\nname-dropping teenagers\u2019 URLs, much the same way people dropped indie rock\nbands in college. Danielle Strle told me about <a href=\"http://cornputer.tumblr.com/\">Cornputer</a>; I had to tell her\nthat Heckacute had gone password-protected. \u201cOh my God, you know Pizza?\u201d Strle\nsaid. \u201cYes.

It took almost two years to get her to talk to me.\nBased on a few posts about blogger meet-ups, I knew she was Australian, but\nnothing had been written about her in the Australian media. I sent her \u201cfan\nmail\u201d on Tumblr, the only option at the time, but popular blogs got tons of such\nmessages, and I got no response. I sent her a direct message on Twitter, to\nwhich she responded with interest, giving me her email, but after an exchange,\nshe went silent. I asked Tumblr to try contacting Pizza for me. No response. I\ntried contacting other kids on Tumblr instead, but they didn\u2019t respond to me\neither. Tumblr\u2019s public relations team reached out to them for me, too, but no\nresponse. I started to lose hope. And then, in August 2015, Jason Wong gave me\na new email for Pizza. (\u201cShe was like a god in people\u2019s eyes,\u201d he said.) She\nreplied, \u201cThank you so much for contacting me and for being interested with my\nblog!\u201d and agreed to talk.</p><p>Jess Miller is a 18-year-old recent high school graduate who lives\nin Melbourne, Australia. Her colleagues and admirers call her Jess, but I can\u2019t\nhelp but think of her as Pizza. Almost her entire teenage life has been lived\non Tumblr, and over the past five years, her fame spread offline. \u201cI didn\u2019t\nreally think I was \u2018popular\u2019 because the number of followers was there but it\ndidn\u2019t really hit me how big the audience I had was until people recognized me\nin public,\u201d she said. \u201cOne day I was in the library and some girls walked into\nthe room I was in, yelled out \u2018Hey Pizza,\u2019 and then ran away.\u201d </p><aside>Lilley would eventually recruit a few hundred kids whose combined Tumblrs would total an estimated 35 million follows.</aside><p><span>Miller\u2019s mom, Jodie Arrowsmith, didn\u2019t know she was on Tumblr for\nthe first few years. \u201cShe actually didn\u2019t tell any of her friends at school,\u201d\nArrowsmith said. \u201cIt was her own special thing. Her Tumblr was her little\nsecret place where she could go and blog and say what she wanted.\u201d But people\nstarted finding out. Arrowsmith is a realtor, and once, while showing a family\na house, she mentioned her kids sat at home on the internet all day. The\nclients\u2019 daughter was about 13, and said she had a Tumblr. \u201cI told her my\ndaughter was Pizza,\u201d Arrowsmith said, \u201cand the girl almost started crying.\u201d</span><br></p><p>In early 2014, when she was 16, some Tumblr users dug up posts\nMiller had written when she was 13 in which she used the word \u201cnigga.\u201d\nScreenshots of <a href=\"http://tsarbucks.tumblr.com/post/72150571279/pizza-awfullydistracted-pizza\">the old posts</a> went viral. At one point, according to Miller, she\nhad 9,500 concurrent visitors on her blog and she received over 2,000 angry\nmessages, some of them telling her to kill herself. When I asked Miller about\nthe posts, she sent me a long apologetic message:</p><blockquote><p>i now completely understand how horrible and ignorant they were\nand take full responsibility for them. theres obviously no excuse for me using\nthat word, and despite the fact that it would be difficult for a 13 year old\naustralian to understand american racial politics, everyone, including me,\nknows that it is not appropriate and i\u2019m so frustrated and disgusted at my 13\nyear old self for thinking that it was acceptable, especially now after I have\ntaken history and we had a whole semester on civil rights and slavery in\namerica and to have a better understanding of the racial issues which were and\nare still present in america make me even more ashamed of my actions</p></blockquote><p> There are still (false) rumors floating around that Pizza was\nterminated by Tumblr <a href=\"http://sataniswhite.tumblr.com/post/72156401910/what-did-pizza-even-do\">for being racist</a>. It\u2019s clear the episode affected\nMiller deeply. An anonymous user left a message on her new blog, Jess Cats.\n\u201cAre you former tumblr user pizza?\u201d She replied, \u201cYep formerly tumblr user\npizza and currently a piece of trash xx.\u201d </p><p>In November 2012, Lilley and Greenfield were contacted by Dennis\nHegstad. Then 23, Hegstad had built an audience on MySpace by posting selfies;\nthin and sleek and handsome, with long, straight, light-brown ombr\u00e9 hair, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dennishegstad/\">he\nresembles a human Afghan hound</a>. He had built his online brand though his looks\nand taste, later producing a popular T-shirt that said, \u201cBlow kisses not coke.\u201d\nHe had connections in the music industry, and in October 2013 he would create\nSongsly, a platform where musicians could pay viral video creators to use their\nsongs.</p><p>When he reached out to So-Relatable, Hegstad had a big Twitter\naudience, millions of followers across a dozen accounts. He had figured out how\nto monetize it, but he wanted to get into Tumblr. So-Relatable was trying to\nbuild its Twitter presence, so they agreed to exchange promotional posts with\nHegstad. </p><p>Tumblr teens need to be sophisticated about making money, and they\nhave clever tactics to increase traffic and followers and revenue, often\nhelping each other to game Google AdSense. Why game AdSense? Tumblr users are\nallowed to put banner ads on their sites, but most users access Tumblr through\nthe dashboard feed, where only Tumblr\u2019s sponsored posts can go. So that means\nmost eyes, and the most dedicated fans, rarely if ever see those banner ads. </p><p>Tumblr has always had a complicated relationship with money. In\n2010, its founder, David Karp, said, \u201c<a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2010/04/tumblr-ads.html\">We\u2019re pretty opposed to advertising. It\nreally turns our stomachs.</a>\u201d Then in 2011: \u201c<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/22/founder-stories-karp-tumblr-making-money/\">Making money off of Tumblr would be\nincredibly easy</a>\u201d\u2014he\u2019d throw up an AdSense ad on every user\u2019s dashboard and\nmake the site \u201cwildly profitable.\u201d In April 2012 sponsored content began\nappearing in users\u2019 streams. Tumblr was, at that time, still a unicorn; the\npossibility of making money was just as powerful an asset as the actual making\nof it. In 2013, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/20/technology/yahoo-buys-tumblr/\">Yahoo bought Tumblr for $1 billion</a> and began a new ad rollout,\nbut after a year, Karp\u2019s wild profitability still hadn\u2019t materialized. A former\nTumblr executive told <i>The New York Times</i> that Tumblr\u2019s anonymity was a\nhurdle: \u201cReal-world identities are valuable to advertisers. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/05/technology/no-regrets-for-the-founder-of-tumblr-after-yahoo-sale.html?_r=0\">Tumblr doesn\u2019t have\nthat</a>.\u201d</p><p>In a sense, Yahoo faces the same problem as Tumblr users: There\nisn\u2019t a lot of money in banner ads. Yahoo is experiencing declining revenue in\ndisplay ads and the company is trying to make up for it with native advertising\u2014ads\nthat look like human-created content but were actually made for brands.\nLikewise, some Tumblr users have tried their own kind of native ads\u2014posts\nendorsing products that link to the stores where you can buy them. Tumblr does\nnot like this. It considers these posts \u201cspam,\u201d and will terminate an account\nfor posting  too many affiliate\nadvertising links, or anything the company deems \u201cnon-genuine social gestures.\u201d\n</p><p>With AdSense banners, users get paid when a reader clicks or views\nan ad. However, Google forbids \u201cclick fraud\u201d\u2014you can\u2019t just click on an ad on\nyour own blog all day and watch the money come in. Google has bots looking for\nthat. So teens have schemes to evade the bots. There are a handful of secret\nFacebook groups and multi-member chats for Tumblr users with high follower\ncounts\u2014between 10,000 and 100,000 or even more\u2014with names like Wallflowers\n2.0 and GOATS. There they organize to trade favors, like agreeing to   promote each other\u2019s posts. An \u201cr4r\u201d in the\nFacebook group is offering an exchange of reblogs, so each blog is exposed to a\nwider set of followers. An \u201cr4c\u201d means a user will reblog a post for someone\nwho promises to visit their blog, refresh it several times, click on the ad,\nand then refresh <i>it</i> several times\u2014but only if you\u2019re from a \u201cpremium\ncountry,\u201d because Google pays more for clicks from Ireland, for example, than\nfrom the Philippines. An ad might specify \u201cplease no car/dating/clothing web\nsites!\u201d because those ads pay less per click. The blog must be refreshed until\na better-paying ad shows up, like one from a bank. </p><p>Lilley and Greenfield felt the sting of a bad exchange a few\ntimes, but the biggest lesson came with Lifehackable. Though they\u2019d exploited\nTom\u2019s failures, he got the better of them in the end. Lilley and Greenfield had\nagreed to split ad revenue 50-50 with Tom, but a few months later, they noticed\nthe ads on the site had been replaced with images promoting Tom\u2019s YouTube\nchannel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/jussttom\">JusstTom</a>. \u201cAs if we\u2019d never notice that all the ads changed to be about\nTom and put his face on them,\u201d Greenfield said. Now Lifehackable.com\u2014which\nonce made $1,963 in a single day\u2014redirects to the YouTube channel.</p><figure><img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/724f1733f4a68f6d466681f66741d373a6a234f0.png?w=800\"></figure><p>Though Tom is handsome, he lacks an easy charisma and JusstTom is\nnot very popular. His videos are about dating advice, and together we watched\nhim explain what to do when a guy won\u2019t text you back. \u201cHe would have been so\nmuch better off if he didn\u2019t screw us over,\u201d Lilley said. Greenfield added, \u201cHe\nhad a great revenue source and just threw it in the trash.\u201d Lilley was\ndisgusted by the thought of \u201ctrying to build a personal brand by sacrificing\nyour content.\u201d The two had chosen to build their empire by not focusing on\ntheir own personalities. </p><p>\u201cTumblr\u2019s different because no one really cares what you look\nlike, they only care about what you post,\u201d Jess Miller told me. Its stars often\nhave as far to climb, at least socioeconomically, as their fans. Wong\u2019s mom\ncouldn\u2019t pay his college tuition, so he\u2019s using Tumblr to pay for it himself.\nHe also pays some of his mom\u2019s bills. When I asked him if his mom approved of\nhis Tumblr career, Wong said he tells her, \u201c\u2018Why is our bank account not in the\nnegative anymore? Why do I have money to go to college?\u2019 It\u2019s better not to\nargue but to just show results.\u201d</p><p>That fall, Hegstad gave Lilley and Greenfield some valuable tips:\nThe end of the year is the most profitable time for banner ads, and he taught\nthem how to tweak the layout of their site and the display of their banner ads.\nFairly subtle stuff, but they made thousands more dollars the next month. \u201cHe\ndid a lot of things that helped us, and he was never getting a piece of it,\u201d\nLilley said. </p><p>At first, Lilley and Greenfield just wanted to make enough money\nto pay their way to the annual YouTube-sponsored conference, VidCon, in Los Angeles,\nbut their vision expanded as So Relatable Inc. took off. In January 2013, they\nquit college. According to their bank records, in March 2013, Google paid them\n$25,350.45. It was lot of money for internet jokes, a lot of money for two\n18-year-olds from Reading, Pennsylvania. Lilley had wanted to get out of his\nhometown for years and proposed moving in with Hegstad in L.A. </p><p>I was skeptical about these numbers, so I asked Lilley and\nGreenfield to drive me to their bank and print out their records. The teller\nknew them, and asked if they missed Los Angeles. They said it never rained.\nThey later told me she always asks them that, even though they\u2019d been home for\nmonths. I also asked them to show me three years of tax returns. They did that\ntoo. The unpredictable waves of virality made the Google payments go up and\ndown based on how many people visited their site\u2014$9,113.04 in May 2013,\n$18,805.09 in June. </p><p>It took a few months, but Lilley and Greenfield decided to move to\nthe West Coast. Lilley made of all of the arrangements with Hegstad, who agreed\nto be their roommate. Greenfield later admitted, \u201cI actually didn\u2019t meet him or\never have a single conversation with him online until the day before we signed\nthe lease.\u201d</p><figure></figure><p>In the summer of 2013, Lilley and Greenfield moved into a historic\nbank building converted into lofts with original art deco details in downtown\nLos Angeles; scenes from <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAjEW2zgs_o\">The Dark Knight Rises</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1s-PVl3k5c\">Spiderman 2</a></i>\nhad been filmed in the lobby. When he first saw the apartment, Lilley thought\nhe\u2019d finally made it. \u201cIt felt like something we could call ours, something we\ncould show for everything we do, which is just on a screen.\u201d</p><p>The loft was multilevel, with stairs next to the living room going\nup to the bedrooms above. Hegstad had the room at the top of the stairs, \u201clike\nhe was king of the jungle.\u201d Lilley decorated his room with a wall decal of\nNotorious B.I.G.\u2019s head and a Tupac Shakur lyric: \u201cYou know my momma used to\ntell me / if you can\u2019t find something to live for / then you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l46NwNB8oQI\">best find\nsomething to die for</a>.\u201d Lilley and Hegstad both loved rap, and they played it\nall day long, so loud it echoed through the walls. \u201cThey were like my little\nbrother\u2019s age,\u201d Hegstad later told me. \u201cThey were cool. Semi-introverted, but\nfun.\u201d </p><p>At 19, neither Lilley nor Greenfield were old enough to drink;\nthey couldn\u2019t enjoy the free beer on tap at the WeWork office they rented, much\nless get into clubs. Instead they spent their off-hours playing video games and\nordering Chinese food. There were parties at the loft, on the rooftop, but the\nguest list was selective\u2014either people they worked with or could possibly work\nwith, because Hegstad, Greenfield recalled, didn\u2019t \u201cassociate with the plebes.\u201d\nLilley discovered Hegstad had a talent for networking, a lot of people did in\nL.A. There were friendly people in the city, for sure, but when Lilley met\nother people in his business, like the people at the roof parties, they always\nseemed to want something. One guest was a British YouTube star who Lilley and\nGreenfield found repellent.</p><blockquote><p><b>Greenfield</b>:<i> </i>He was\nlike, \u201cWow, this is such a great view. I want to come and fuck a girl up here.\nI want to set up a screen.\u201d</p><p><b>Lilley</b>:<i> </i>He was like, \u201cI\u2019d smash\nevery night on this roof.\u201d</p><p><b>Greenfield</b>: And then\nsomeone was like, \u201cBut all those neighbors can see you.\u201d Because if you\u2019re on\nour roof, there\u2019s at any given time hundreds of people that can see you. And\nhe\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019d set up a screen and broadcast it.\u201d</p><p><b>Lilley</b>: And not to\nmention the police in their helicopters. That\u2019s a crime. Exposure.</p></blockquote><p> <span>So-Relatable and its associated blogs had a good summer, and in\nSeptember they made $24,296.26 with Google AdSense. With traffic on the rise,\nHegstad suggested they move to DoubleClick, Google\u2019s premium ad network, and\nthe move made October their biggest monthly payout to date: $54,269.33. Lilley\nand Greenfield\u2019s tax returns showed they made $249,000 that year. The three of\nthem started to think about building a company that would connect brands to\nTumblr blogs and cut out the middleman\u2014or better yet, </span><i>become</i><span> the\nmiddleman and take a cut. (\u201cEveryone who\u2019s been a publisher has had that\nthought,\u201d said Lilley.) It would be a platform on which social media accounts\ncould find advertising campaigns to post on their site, and they would charge a\nportion of the revenue for the convenience. They\u2019d call the company Exposely.</span></p><p>But at the end of 2013, disaster: AdSense banned Lilley and\nGreenfield just as they were due a large check\u2014Greenfield estimated it was\n$50,000. Months later, an anonymous person claiming to be a Google employee\nwould post <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/qh6Tta3h\">a supposed tell-all </a>on Pastebin, a text-sharing site used primarily\nby coders, claiming that AdSense intentionally bans people just before big\nchecks are due. (Many tech blogs suspect the confession is a fake.) A class action\nlawsuit was filed against Google in 2014, and Business Insider noted, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/google-adsense-leak-fake-conspiracy-theory-2014-5#ixzz31dKpfs8M\">Google\noften behaves so mysteriously</a> that many advertisers and publishers will\nactually welcome the suit: It may finally shed some light on exactly how and\nwhy Google kicks web sites out of its vast, $60 billion-a-year advertising\nsystem.\u201d The class action case was dismissed in early 2015, as was a similar\nsuit, in which Google <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/super-cray-sues-google-for-500k-2015-1\">canceled a site\u2019s account when it allegedly owed\n$535,000</a>, then later reinstated it, but didn\u2019t pay the money. \u201cIt was a huge\nwake-up call,\u201d Lilley said. \u201cIt felt like working somewhere, putting in a lot\nof work, and you show up one day and they throw all your shit in a box and\nthey\u2019re like \u2018get the fuck out\u2019 and they won\u2019t even say why you were fired.\u201d</p><p>Still, they continued with Exposely, sometimes working 60 hours a\nweek. The pair hardly ventured outside the loft. Hegstad hired a developer,\nGreenfield worked on support, while Lilley recruited bloggers from Tumblr,\nfocusing on users with the biggest accounts. Through So-Relatable they\u2019d met\nmany users with high follower counts\u2014the same kids who were trading\npromotional links in the Facebook groups. Lilley would eventually recruit a few\nhundred kids, mostly teen humor blogs, whose combined Tumblrs would total an estimated\n35 million followers. His recruits included the biggest teen comedy blog of\nall: Pizza.</p><p>Jess Miller was 16 in the spring of 2014. She had just weathered\nthe racism controversy and now had more than half a million followers. David\nKarp had been following her for a year. Her boyfriend started a Tumblr with the\nuser name Moistbottom, and while they didn\u2019t really write about their\nrelationship, they were the subject of intense fan interest. (When an anonymous\nuser asked Moistbottom, \u201chow far have you and Jess gone?\u201d he responded, \u201c<a href=\"http://ledgendairy.tumblr.com/post/92918467339/how-far-have-you-and-jess-gone\">TO THE\nBEACH</a>.\u201d)</p><p><span>Lilley and Greenfield were unabashed fans of Miller; they\nrespected her social strategy and were quick to recall her best posts. Lilley\nsent her a Facebook message the day he arrived on the West Coast</span><i>: </i><span>\u201ci\u2019m\nin LA!\u201d Even before Exposely, they\u2019d had a business relationship: Lilley and\nGreenfield paid her $10 to reblog three posts to her huge audience. Miller was\n\u201cvery fair with her prices,\u201d Lilley said. \u201cIt was like buying popularity, but\nit was real.\u201d When Miller had started making money off of her Tumblr, her\nmother had to create the PayPal account for her because she was under 18, but\nthe bank account was solely Miller\u2019s. Her mother told me at her peak her\ndaughter was making $2,800 to $8,400 a week in U.S. dollars\u2014more than she\nherself earned as a Melbourne-area real estate agent.</span></p><figure><img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/aedc623a4d9390999d22e1dfe7d17be1a3463096.png?w=800\"></figure><p>In Facebook messages, Lilley congratulated Miller on reaching new\nmilestones. When she hit 800,000 followers, he wrote, \u201ci\u2019m just waiting for you\nto hit a million, not if but when. just keep doing your thing you obvi don\u2019t\nneed me to say that to you I just am sometimes blown away like woah so yeah.\u201d\nMiller was always gracious: \u201cthank you!! hahaha i rly hope i get 1 mill cos\nthat\u2019d be crazy wow.\u201d In April 2014, Lilley messaged Miller about a new way to\nmake money: \u201cI\u2019m signing up people, would love for you to be one of our first\npublishers on exposely!\u201d </p><p>Exposely had a major selling point for kids in a similar position\nto So-Relatable: Its Google AdSense account would be a way for teens who\u2019d been\nbanned to still make money from ads. Exposely offered its publishers both pay\nper click and pay per conversion. The pay-per-click scheme worked like this:\nExposely set up three garbage content sites with mindless slide shows\u2014<a href=\"http://sobadsogood.com/2012/03/29/14-celebrities-that-look-like-mattresses/\">14\nCelebrities That Look Like Mattresse</a>s\u2014called Trending.ly, Styles.ly, and\nEats.ly. There were ads on each page of the slide show, and the kids would post\na couple slides from the site on their Tumblrs, with the right headline and\ntext along the lines of <i>omg this is so funny</i>. The ads tracked which\nTumblr sent the traffic, and the teens were paid 75 percent of the ad revenue\nfor each click.</p><p>The pay-per-conversion program could make more money, but it cost\nits users something else entirely. Hegstad got an account at a health affiliate\nnetwork\u2014a snake-oil sales depot. The idea was to create an advertisement\nmimicking a Tumblr post, and the ad would include a link to a diet pill site.\nIf a person clicked on the ad, went to the site, and bought a bottle of pills\ncontaining synthetic raspberry ketone, the Tumblr user who reblogged the ad\nwould get $18\u2014after Exposely took a $20 cut. </p><p>Raspberry ketone is a compound that gives raspberries their\ndistinctive smell and taste. In its natural form it is very expensive, and is\noften used by the perfume industry. Synthetic raspberry ketone, however, is\ncheaper to produce, and <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Diet/raspberry-ketones-frenzy/story?id=16074044\">when Dr. Oz hailed the substance as a miracle\nfat-burner</a> in 2012, he began a raspberry ketone media frenzy. One study\nindicated mice fed a super high dosage while on a high-fat diet <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15862604\">did not gain as\nmuch fat in the liver,</a> but there\u2019s no evidence it makes humans thin. In 2013, a\n24-year-old woman <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2866843/Woman-died-taking-overdose-raspberry-ketone-slimming-pills.html\">fatally overdosed on a version made by Forza</a>\u2014the pills also\nhave a ton of caffeine.</p><p>Hegstad figured out a way to make a landing page for the diet\npills by looking at what his competitors did. (\u201cI would hate to say clone and\nmodify,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s kind of a good place to start.\u201d) It resulted in a\nhuge conversion rate\u2014as high as 10 percent\u2014by featuring before-and-after\nphotos claiming people had lost weight with the pills, and a video of Dr. Oz\nclaiming they burn fat. (The celebrity doctor <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/17/health/senate-grills-dr-oz/\">was berated at a 2014 Senate\nhearing</a> for misleading his audience about the efficacy of \u201cmiracle\u201d weight-loss\nsupplements.)</p><p> \u201cThe whole point of the\nvideo was to reinforce that this is a real thing, this has been on television\neven,\u201d Lilley said. \u201cIt was just crazy how much it worked,\u201d he said, not of the\npills, but of the landing page.</p><p>So in between Tumblr posts about life\u2019s daily tragedies, like\nsomeone stepping on the back of your shoe, there appeared these diet pill\nposts. A Tumblr user explained to me that So-Relatable had an advantage by\nposting these ads, because their blog had a theme of relatable quotes and life\nhacks. The fit was natural. \u201cLife Hack: You can lose 20 pounds per month with\nthis magic pill.\u201d</p><figure><img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/c0eafac9b8fecfd484763e50f521ba120cf47ac0.png?w=800\"></figure><p>Lilley wrote the diet pill ads, and as with all his work on\nTumblr, he did it very well. He began by reading up on David Ogilvy, \u201cthe\n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/22/business/david-ogilvy-88-father-of-soft-sell-in-advertising-dies.html?pagewanted=all\">father of advertising</a>,\u201d and he learned the best ad is often the one that\ndoesn\u2019t seem like an ad. \u201cThe idea was to make an ad that looks like word of\nmouth from a fellow user,\u201d he said. It\u2019s easy to ignore a TV spot by a\nstranger, \u201cbut if it\u2019s presented to you in a way that she\u2019s your peer, she\u2019s a\nsimilar person to you, you don\u2019t even know her in the same way, but it feels\ndifferent. It\u2019s like it seems more genuine.\u201d You know, more relatable.</p><p>\u201cHi I\u2019m Brittany and this is my weight loss story!\u201d Lilley crafted\nhis testimonials from a girl\u2019s perspective, honing the copy, making sure the\nline breaks were just right. The posts showed the familiar diptych of a woman\nlooking self-conscious and curvy on the left and happy and thin on the right,\nand underneath, a testimony about pounds melting off without pain and\nsuffering. </p><p>\u201c\u2018My best friend recommended it\u2019 was one of my more major\ncontributions,\u201d Lilley said. He read from the post: \u201c\u2018I lost 24 pounds in four\nweeks with minor exercise and no change in diet. Here\u2019s how I did it: with this\norganic supplement\u2019\u2014that doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d But \u201c\u2009\u2018Here\u2019s how I did it: with\nthis organic supplement <i>my best friend recommended</i>\u2019\u2014just seemed to me\nmore real-sounding and \u2026 just makes it seem like in the back of someone\u2019s mind\nthey could think, well, my best friend could have recommended this to me.\u201d </p><p>Exposely\u2019s diet pill scheme got going in April 2014, and it worked\u2014it\nworked like crazy. Trending.ly got almost 7 million views that month, and with\nthe diet pill ads, they sometimes achieved a conversion rate near 10 percent.\nOnce, across all their blogs, Exposely made $24,000 in a single day. </p><p>The Tumblr teens loved it. Lilley showed me messages asking when\nthey\u2019d get their money\u2014pay-for-click was monthly, pay-for-conversion was\nweekly\u2014often doing the math to make sure they were paid for all conversions.\nOne kid messaged Lilley, \u201ci\u2019m so proud of you and all your hard work.\u201d Lilley\nhad to explain to Miller she had to fill out a tax form\u2014\u201cwe need to have\neveryone fill one out like to run our business legitimately and stuff.\u201d But he\nhad good news: \u201ccheck your balance tho :)\u201d She replied, \u201cYOURE THE BEST PERSON\nIN THE WHOLE WORLD TJANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU :))))))\u201d</p><p>Then in June 2014, Pizza reached an unheard of milestone for a\nTumblr teen: \u201cpizza hit 1 million followers today. I am small and weak,\u201d one\nTumblr user wrote. \u201ceveryone buy pizza today to celebrate jess pizza hitting 1\nmillion followers!\u201d another said. \u201cHEY BIG CONGRATS!! I KNEW YOU\u2019D DO IT J OMG\nA MILLION HOW\u2019S IT FEEL,\u201d Lilley told her. Miller replied: \u201cTHANKS!! AND IT\nFEELS SO GOOD LIKE WOW 1 MILLION PEOPLE?!?! J\u201d Lilley wrote back, \u201cYEAH THATS\nAMAZING \u2026 HERES TO THE NEXT MILLION \u2026 YOU DESERVE IT ALL \u2026 Btw wanna get\nanother reblog deal going?\u201d</p><p>That same month, Lilley wrote another Tumblr user, \u201cin a few\nmonths I bet we\u2019ll be doing milli\u2019s. We got our biggest check ever from Adsense\ncoming for Exposely, 160k coming. That\u2019s for everyone that posted rev-share\nincluding us but still.\u201d For Lilley, the \u201cmilli\u2019s\u201d didn\u2019t come. In July 2014,\nExposely was banned from AdSense too.</p><p>It was the next month that it happened. On August 19, just days\nbefore his twentieth birthday, Lilley tried to log in to So-Relatable but\ncouldn\u2019t. Greenfield checked the site, which redirected to an error page:\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here. Whatever you were looking for doesn\u2019t currently exist at\nthis address.\u201d They\u2019d been terminated, their blogs revoked by Tumblr for\nviolating its terms of service. </p></div></div><figure> <div> <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/035226a408e4a36cfffd1c9a112f118b33aa8327.png?w=200&amp;fm=gif\"> <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/035226a408e4a36cfffd1c9a112f118b33aa8327.png?w=200&amp;fm=gif\"> <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/035226a408e4a36cfffd1c9a112f118b33aa8327.png?w=200&amp;fm=gif\"> <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/035226a408e4a36cfffd1c9a112f118b33aa8327.png?w=200&amp;fm=gif\"> <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/035226a408e4a36cfffd1c9a112f118b33aa8327.png?w=200&amp;fm=gif\"> <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/035226a408e4a36cfffd1c9a112f118b33aa8327.png?w=200&amp;fm=gif\"> </div></figure><div><div><p>Tumblr had just dissolved the sites of some of its most popular\nteenage users, an estimated 30 million follows <i>gone</i>. Including Pizza.\nBlogs that had brought relief from unremitting high school agony and then\nmiraculously made their teen creators more money than they could have ever\nimagined, were erased from the internet, except for fragments reblogged on other\nsites. The day before, if they\u2019d had a funny thought, they could share it with\nhalf a million people. And now, nothing.<span> </span></p><figure></figure><p>For three days, Jess Miller stayed in bed, shocked. <i>My blog is\ngone. </i>Over the next week, the terminated teens created a huge Facebook\ngroup chat; its thousands of messages are filled with anguish and denial and\nregret: \u201cThey took away our lives,\u201d and \u201cThe worst part is that everything was\njust ripped out from under us.\u201d One user heard of another user who got her blog\nback by claiming she had cancer; another said they were related to a lawyer;\nand slowly the messages revealed the cruel social dynamics of high school:</p><blockquote><p>its just sad because all the friends ive made and stuff</p><p>yeah i feel that \u2026 but most of my real tumblr friends have left now</p><p>and the fact that like half our friends wrote us off like we\nliterally got kicked out of the high fc humor blog club lmao </p><p>i just don\u2019t understand how the hell people could be so two faced</p><p>I hate most of the new people </p><p>Especially the new people that think they\u2019re top shit theres always like waves of new people on tumblr that rise up and\nmake it shittier</p><p>i remember hitting 25k on my blog at the end of 2k12 and being so\nhappy </p></blockquote><p>Miller was invited to the chat, but as was often the case, she was\ntalked about far more than she actually talked. Other banned kids pasted Tumblr\nposts from Miller\u2019s haters\u2014when one user wrote \u201chow did pizza get deleted?\u201d\nanother replied \u201cdon\u2019t question blessings.\u201d In the group chat, kids were puzzled\nby the intensity of the emotion Miller inspired. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why so\nmany people followed her if they hated her\u2026\u201d Another replied, \u201clmfao her blogs\ngone and ppl r still talking about her so famous.\u201d Impersonators grabbed URLs\nlike iwaspizza.tumblr.com; hundreds of people tweeted at her, asking where\nshe\u2019d gone. </p><p>Lilley and Greenfield had unwittingly spread the poison that would\nkill a huge section of the teen Tumblr world. Lilley had told his friends they\nwere safe (\u201cI fucked up telling you guys that\u201d), but he lost his accounts, too,\nand wouldn\u2019t have used the ads if he knew it\u2019d get them banned. After all,\nTumblr ran ads for diet pills too, Lilley sent me a screenshot of one\u2014among\nseveral bottles was one containing raspberry ketones. (A Tumblr spokesperson\nacknowledged the ad \u201cappears to be a violation of our ad policies,\u201d and was\npossibly part of an ad network that is \u201cno longer in effect on Tumblr.\u201d)</p><p>This has not changed Tumblr\u2019s mind about the banned users. \u201cEven\nthe most savvy online teens can sometimes fall victim to the modern spammer,\u201d\nDanielle Strle said when I asked about the Great Termination. She acknowledged\nthis is partly because it\u2019s harder to monetize fame on Tumblr than on other\nsocial networks. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to be tempted by stuff that promises you the most\nmoney or the most return for your reach. I think they were perhaps underwhelmed\nby maybe more professional options that promise less payment.\u201d (In January\n2015, Tumblr launched <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/creatrs\">Creatrs Network</a>, where the company pays Tumblr artists to\ncreate ads for brands like Converse and Tresemm\u00e9.) Users can still put whatever\nbanner ads they want on their page, she said. \u201cWhere it crosses the line is if\nthey\u2019re abusing the viral mechanisms of Tumblr.\u201d</p><p>In addition to \u201cnon-genuine social gestures,\u201d Tumblr terminates\nblogs for \u201cspam or affiliate marketing\u201d and \u201cdeceptive means to generate\ntraffic/revenue.\u201d Lilley argued that Twitter never bans people for tweeting\ndiet pill ads, but his many, many emails to Tumblr have led nowhere. \u201cThey\nnever thought it was a violation in the first place,\u201d one blogger told me. \u201cNo\none tried to be sneaky. All they saw was money, not the safety of their blog,\nwhich was potentially worth more than whatever they made.\u201d</p></div></div><figure><div>\n                                            <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/2da4ffa4b97d9e1ad1520da837790e29ba33c575.gif?w=200&amp;fm=gif\">\n                                            <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/2da4ffa4b97d9e1ad1520da837790e29ba33c575.gif?w=200&amp;fm=gif\">\n                                            <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/2da4ffa4b97d9e1ad1520da837790e29ba33c575.gif?w=200&amp;fm=gif\">\n                                            <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/2da4ffa4b97d9e1ad1520da837790e29ba33c575.gif?w=200&amp;fm=gif\">\n                                            <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/2da4ffa4b97d9e1ad1520da837790e29ba33c575.gif?w=200&amp;fm=gif\">\n                                            <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/2da4ffa4b97d9e1ad1520da837790e29ba33c575.gif?w=200&amp;fm=gif\">\n                                        </div></figure><div><div><p>Two months after the termination of the Tumblr teens, <i>Fast\nCompany</i> ran <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3037041/most-creative-people/inside-the-mind-of-a-25-year-old-super-tech-savvy-consumer-whispering-p\">a puff piece on Dennis Hegstad and his empire</a>. \u201cHe\u2019s not just\ntweeting for fun; he\u2019s tweeting for big money\u2014and he\u2019s winning,\u201d the magazine\nwrote. \u201cIn Hegstad\u2019s model, clients are charged a fee for services that include\naffiliate marketing, lead generation, and content distribution.

A remaining campaign peddled\n<a href=\"http://www.tenslife.com/\">sunglasses whose lenses supposedly worked like an Instagram filter</a>. </p><p>Lilley and Greenfield said Hegstad had promised them equity in\nExposely, and Hegstad confirmed they\u2019d discussed both equity and becoming\npartners, but the company\u2019s future was uncertain. <a href=\"https://exposely.com/\">Exposely</a> still exists, and\nHegstad is listed as the founder on its web site, but the day I talked to him\nthe site was down\u2014its security certificate had expired. Hegstad agreed\nExposely was the apparent reason several blogs were terminated and that users\nassociated with the site were still at risk. \u201cA lot of the Tumblr bloggers who\nwere using Exposely a year ago that haven\u2019t used it in almost a year have lost\ntheir blogs.\u201d<span> <br></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/035226a408e4a36cfffd1c9a112f118b33aa8327.png?w=800\"></figure><p>In February 2015, Lilley and Greenfield left the loft in downtown\nL.A. and returned to Reading. According to their tax returns, the pair made\nonly $72,000 in 2014, a third of the previous year\u2019s revenue. With neither\nAdSense nor Exposely to turn clicks into cash, there wasn\u2019t enough money to\nafford life in L.A.</p><p>Back in Pennsylvania, Lilley and Greenfield worked to rebuild but\nkept hitting more walls. They joined an affiliate marketing program with\nChaCha, which offers a service in which users can submit a question and a\nChaCha human will answer in real time. In June, ChaCha canceled So-Relatable\u2019s\naccounts while a large payment was due. Lilley showed me emails he exchanged\nwith ChaCha\u2019s financial controller. \u201cUnfortunately, the program has not been\nprofitable for us, so now we must make some difficult changes. This means we\nwill be deferring indefinitely the payment scheduled for June 7,\u201d he wrote on\nJune 5. Greenfield grumbled, \u201cHow can it not be profitable if they didn\u2019t pay\nanyone?\u201d Lilley isn\u2019t sure what to do now. Facebook\u2019s algorithms make it hard\nto get their content in front of much more than 10 percent of the people who\nlike their pages. He\u2019s thinking about Instagram\u2014everybody said to get into\nInstagram, but he doesn\u2019t know how to do it\u2014and he\u2019s been holding on to a\ncommercial YouTube URL that he might start working on.</p><p>When I visited Lilley and Greenfield last September, they were\nearning around $8,000 a month posting ads for surveys on their remaining blogs,\nwhich was OK, but they wanted more. Hours after I drove away from the\nGreenfield family home, Tumblr terminated another one of their sites,\nNowYouKno, so they turned their focus to Movie, which had 185,000 followers\u2014it\nwas soon terminated, too. So were VinesNow, So-True, and ListHacks. Now they\u2019re\nbuilding WordPress sites instead of Tumblrs: MightyFacts.com and RelatableCards.com.\n(Tagline: \u201cCards that make you nod.\u201d) WordPress gives them more freedom, but\nthe sites haven\u2019t gotten much traction.</p><p>Lilley is done with diet pills. He never planned to do them in the\nfirst place. He still feels responsible for the end of Pizza, and he still\ncan\u2019t believe she\u2019s gone. \u201cJess. I still can\u2019t wrap my head around it,\never,\u201d he said. \u201cShe liked something of mine on Instagram the other day, and I\nwas just like, Damn. She lost all of it.\u201d</p><p>In a way, Miller is better off; she\u2019s younger, after all, a Tumblr\ntween turned Tumblr teen. She graduated high school last November and was\naccepted to a college program to study commerce and arts. Greenfield and Lilley\nquit college as freshmen to make a career out of their Tumblrs\u2014it\u2019s the only\nway they know how to make money.</p><p>While reporting this story, I went to a dinner party with a group\nof people who make their living writing on the internet. The conversation\nturned to teens; the consensus was that modern kids are dumb and boring. \u201cGirls\nthese days don\u2019t keep diaries,\u201d one woman said. \u201cI think that means they don\u2019t\nhave inner lives.\u201d That we would soon depart for a thirtieth birthday party was\nno coincidence\u2014you don\u2019t have to fear the teens if you can live in denial\nabout your own looming obsolescence. </p><p>Having spent several years among teens who have freely laid bare\ntheir inside jokes, their Facebook messages, and their deepest thoughts, I\nthink there are three phases of understanding the teens. At first you loathe\nthe teens, because you know nothing about them and think they\u2019re idiots,\nbeneath you. Then you love the teens because you figure out they are smarter\nthan you, and you make peace with the death of your cultural relevance, because\nyou know you\u2019ll be in good hands. Finally, you recognize the shape of the\nadults they\u2019ll become, corrupted by money and vanity and hubris just like\neveryone else. And you\u2019ll see yourself in them because they\u2019re relatable: That\nmoment you realize the teens are just like you.</p></div></div><figure></figure></div>", "thumbnail": "https://images.newrepublic.com/513cdbb7f965cef821778f75091b68c5e43d1f5f.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
