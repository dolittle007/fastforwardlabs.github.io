These will sell for as much as $30,000. One woman peered into a microscope as she carefully wielded a long, thin needle to apply a drop of pink oil, before setting a tiny pin in place. This is the tradition that Koeslag is selling to his customers: the patient Swiss art of manufacturing complex, handmade mechanisms.</p><p>Last fall, however, Koeslag set off on a very different, decidedly 21st-century project: a smartwatch. In response to Apple\u2019s plans to introduce a high-tech watch this year, the chief executive of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant, Peter Stas, decided the company would produce its own. It would not be a minicomputer with a screen, like Apple\u2019s. Instead, it would combine the functions of a Fitbit, a device that tracks physical activity, with a traditional Swiss timepiece, a $1,200 entry-level Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant watch. A Silicon Valley company would produce the tiny sensors that count steps and measure sleep cycles, and this information would be transmitted to a phone through a Bluetooth connection. The phone would also control the watch \u2014 resetting its hands in different time zones, for example. From the outside, the watch wouldn\u2019t look \u201csmart\u201d at all, but it would be packed with electronics. Koeslag\u2019s job was to bring to life this chimera of Swiss engineering and Silicon Valley wizardry.</p><p>Koeslag faced a significant problem, though: He had never worked with chips and sensors before. He didn\u2019t even own a soldering iron. Swiss watchmakers don\u2019t need them; their devices are put together with screws and screwdrivers.</p>\n<p>He led me to a large microscope and placed one of the chip sets under it. When the image appeared on a large computer screen, he zoomed in on the Bluetooth antenna, which looked like a dark, square block. Getting that into the right spot caused him a great deal of trouble, he said.</p><p>\u201cUnder the microscope, we actually welded it on, by hand,\u201d he said. To install it properly, he sought advice from an associate at a technology company. \u201cI said, \u2018I have to place this big antenna, which way do I put it?\u2019\u2009\u201d The technician told him it couldn\u2019t be done manually; technology companies use robots to fix in place components that require that kind of precision. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll see.\u2019\u2009\u201d He had to shave the tip of his soldering iron down to a fine point to use it successfully.</p><p>By January, he finally had a prototype working well, just in time to show it off at Baselworld, the annual Swiss jewelers\u2019 and watchmakers\u2019 fair. Watch designers typically boast about their latest \u201ccomplications,\u201d clever ways of creating gear work to power new features, like calendars or extra dials. This year, though, the chatter at Basel kept coming nervously back to the Apple smartwatch. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant was producing its enhanced watch, and a few Swiss companies were announcing similar plans. But what did this trend mean for the industry? Should they move into smartwatches? Adding chips might help these watchmakers ride the high-tech wave, but it also risked eroding what made them special.</p><p>The prospect made Koeslag jittery. The night before the show, he wore his smartwatch to bed. It tracked his sleep patterns. \u201cI was so stressed I woke up eight times,\u201d he said. His deep sleep totaled just 25 minutes. Many observers had predicted that Apple would spell trouble for Swiss watchmakers, and now Koeslag had some personal data to prove it.</p><p><strong>Smartwatches have been</strong> around for years, but none have received as much attention as the Apple Watch. Much of the allure, of course, was Apple\u2019s famously elegant design. It was recognizably a watch, complete with a crown that controlled on-screen apps, but it had Apple\u2019s distinctive aesthetic, with its minimal lines and sleek curves; the watch is a smaller version of an iPhone, essentially.</p><p>Very few companies can turn out such consistently glossy electronics, because few sell enough of their devices to justify the automated processes that keep quality high and prices relatively affordable. For example, to achieve the satiny finish on the bodies of the Apple Watch Sport, the company uses robotized nozzles to blast the aluminum surface with microscopic beads of zirconia. \u201cNo company in the world is finishing and anodizing to Apple\u2019s level,\u201d the product designer Greg Koenig has written. The company\u2019s design prowess rests in part on its mastery of high-volume operations like this.</p><p>Swiss watchmaking emerged from a radically different background, one rooted in meticulous manual labor. The industry got its start in the 16th century after John Calvin persuaded the City Council in Geneva to impose sumptuary laws banning jewelry, and the city\u2019s skilled jewelers joined forces with the makers of pocket watches instead. Later, French Catholics chased Protestant Huguenots out of their country; many of these French exiles happened to be watchmakers, and they settled in Switzerland. In the mountains of the Jura region, they encountered local farmers who spent half the year indoors and idle and who turned out to be extremely patient and detail-oriented. The \u00e9migr\u00e9s hired them to spend their winters hand-polishing tiny metal components for the \u201cmovements,\u201d the watch\u2019s spring-driven inner workings.</p><figure>\n    \n    <div>\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/07/magazine/07watch2/07mag-07watch-t_CA0-blog427.jpg\">\n            \n            \n    </div>\n        <figcaption>\n                <span>A technician inspects the movement of a watch at the Frederique Constant factory.</span>\n                        <span>\n            \n            Jonathan De Villiers for The New York Times        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<p>By the 20th century, Swiss watches had become famous for their reliability and complexity. They are also marvels of energy efficiency, because dozens or even hundreds of components depend on tiny wound springs for power. Each new \u201ccomplication\u201d \u2014 say, a calendar that advances the date with a satisfying snap at midnight \u2014 demanded a new set of gears and more energy, thus requiring ever more clever compensations. A mechanical watch is both a dance with and a fight against physics.</p>\n<p>In the early 1970s, centuries of tradition were overturned by an upstart technology: quartz watches. In these, a battery\u2019s electricity causes a quartz crystal to vibrate at an extremely regular frequency, running a motor that turns the watch hands. The resulting timepiece is far more accurate and much cheaper than most mechanical watches. Swiss inventors actually helped pioneer this technology, but watchmakers regarded it as beneath them. A quartz watch might have only a few dozen parts, compared with hundreds in a mechanical one. Where was the challenge?</p><p>When Swiss companies declined to make quartz devices, inexpensive Japanese watches from companies like Seiko became popular around the world. The \u201cquartz crisis\u201d killed off so many Swiss watchmakers that by the end of the 1970s, the number of workers in the industry had shrunk to 30,000 from 90,000. Brands in existence for centuries vanished in a puff of disruption.</p><p>In the 1980s, Swiss companies came back. Swatch introduced a line of inexpensive quartz watches, and other Swiss companies followed its lead. In the 1990s, as Ryan Raffaelli, a Harvard business professor who has studied the Swiss industry, has written, Swiss watchmakers hit on an even more profitable strategy: marketing their expensive mechanical watches as luxury items steeped in history. If you wanted to hand something down to your children, the sales pitch went, spend thousands of dollars on a Rolex or, at the very least, several hundred on a quartz watch with elegant Swiss design. Sales of Swiss watches rebounded; exports have more than doubled since 2000, rising even in the years after the economic meltdown.</p><p>These days, nobody needs a watch to know the time. Time is all around us, displayed on every computer, phone and microwave oven. The Swiss watchmakers realize this. They market their mechanical watches as not only accurate but also deeply symbolic. For those willing to spend $30,000, a traditional Swiss watch marks its owner as a man or woman who appreciates quality, artistry and ingenuity (and, of course, as a wealthy and conspicuous consumer). Wearing a mechanical watch today makes an explicitly antidigital statement, embracing the long pedigree of a device that predates not only computers but electricity itself. It tells the time but is timeless. \u201cA mechanical watch,\u201d Jean-Claude Biver, the chief executive of TAG Heuer, said, \u201cis a piece of eternity in a box.\u201d</p><p>Is the smartwatch the next \u201cquartz crisis\u201d? Few Swiss executives think smartwatches will kill off the high-end market. Nobody, they argue, who spends $50,000 on a piece of handmade eternity will regard an Apple Watch as a substitute. But luxury brands also sell a great many less-expensive quartz watches, and this is where the Apple Watch poses a threat.</p>        \n    </div>\n    <div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n    \n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        \n<p>\u201cIf a young man, young woman, is 25 years old, would they rather put 1,200 Swiss francs\u201d \u2014 about $1,300 \u2014 \u201cfor a watch that tells you what time it is and the date, or will they buy, for only $800, a watch that tells you everything?\u201d Biver said. \u201cFor me there is no doubt we will have a very tough competition in the $1,200 price segment.\u201d</p><p>For Switzerland to compete with Silicon Valley, it needed to answer a question that was no longer just stylistic or technical but existential. Raffaelli said, \u201cWhat does it mean to be a watchmaker in a digital world?\u201d</p><p><strong>Peter Stas began</strong> pondering that question two years ago. A Dutch \u00e9migr\u00e9 in Switzerland, Stas and his wife, Aletta, founded Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant in 1988 to make the sort of midlevel quartz timepieces now threatened by Apple. Their watches retail for $1,000 and more: \u201cClassical, accessible luxury,\u201d he called them as he sat in his office, surrounded by models of his mahogany motorboat.</p>\n<p>At first, Stas considered making a smartwatch through and through \u2014 LCD screen, apps, Google\u2019s free operating system for wearable devices. He consulted a Portuguese design team but couldn\u2019t find a concept he liked. One crucial issue was power. Watches can accommodate only very small batteries, so users would have to charge their watches every night. (This has been a complaint leveled against the Apple Watch.) The energy-hungry display would be turned off most of the time and activated with a flick of the wrist, but the gesture isn\u2019t always successful. (Another complaint about Apple\u2019s watch: You turn your wrist to check the time, and the screen remains dark.) Like most watchmakers, Stas wanted his quartz watches to run for two years on a single battery.</p><p>A subtler problem was the screen shape. In 2013, the only LCDs available to him were rectangular. \u201cAnd in the watch industry,\u201d Stas told me, \u201cwe know actually that square screens don\u2019t sell to men.\u201d</p><p>So if a screen-based smartwatch wasn\u2019t viable, he wondered, was there another alternative? Stas knew that \u201cactivity tracker\u201d wristbands were popular. A watch is inherently a wristband, albeit a prettier one. After hunting online for suitable electronics to work with, Stas found Fullpower Technologies, a company in Santa Cruz, Calif., that makes the sensors and firmware in activity-trackers built by companies like Nike. He contacted Philippe Kahn, the chief executive, who told Stas that Fullpower\u2019s technology could run for two years on one watch battery. Better yet, Kahn could make the phone software for Stas. It would analyze activity and deep-sleep patterns, so the watch\u2019s alarm could go off at precisely the least disruptive time to wake its wearer.</p>\n<p>The prospect of a partnership excited Stas. Kahn too: He detested the environmental waste of many disposable electronics and loved the idea of building sensors into a watch sufficiently expensive that it would be regarded as an heirloom. Watches are easy to open and repair, unlike many of today\u2019s electronics. When Fullpower develops new sensors a few years from now, owners can have their Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant watches upgraded with better electronics.</p><p>\u201cThe Swiss watch industry sells tens of millions of watches a year, and they are wearable objects that people tend to keep,\u201d Kahn told me. \u201cI\u2019m a dad, and I\u2019ve got kids, and I don\u2019t want to leave a Kleenex world where nothing\u2019s worth fixing and everything gets thrown away.\u201d</p><p>In pursuing an analog design, they hit upon an intriguing concept. Using the phone app, the owner can set an activity goal, like 8,000 steps for a day. Then the watch displays how close you are to meeting it, using the hand on a small, secondary dial: At 2,000 steps, for example, the hand would point to 3 o\u2019clock, signifying 25 percent. Eventually, the dial could quantify all sorts of data: How full is your inbox? How close is your friend to arriving at the restaurant? To Ronnie Bernheim, co-owner (with his brother Andr\u00e9) of the watchmaker Mondaine, which is licensing some of Stas\u2019s and Koeslag\u2019s technology, this approach is superior to the blunt accuracy of a screen. A watch hand is \u201cglanceable,\u201d as he puts it, because it\u2019s only semi-accurate; we peek at an analog wall clock to get a general sense of the time of day, not a precise one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not interested if it\u2019s 23 percent or 27 percent.\u201d Bernheim said. \u201cYou only want to know \u2018Do I have to move or have I already done pretty good?\u2019\u2009\u201d (The French watchmaker Withings began selling a cheaper watch with similar capabilities this spring.)</p><p>When Koeslag handed me a Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant smartwatch to try on, it had a pleasantly hefty feel. It didn\u2019t seem like a smartwatch at all; there was nothing visibly electronic about it. I loved it. I\u2019m a fan of gadgets and even wore early, clunky smartwatches with LCD screens able to display texts and tweets. But Koeslag\u2019s stylish analog design felt like a steampunk midpoint, the best of both domains: a device that delivered modern types of information, with the romance of old-fashioned dials.</p>\n<p>Bernheim and Stas are diplomatic about the Apple Watch. \u201cWe try to be nice,\u201d Stas said. But he thinks its limitations \u2014 especially the hassle of charging it every night \u2014 will deter some would-be owners. \u201cThere will be plenty of people who are going to buy them. I think the real question will be in three months, five months, if people are still going to wear them.\u201d</p><p>He is even more dubious that any Silicon Valley company could create something with aesthetics lovely enough to penetrate the European luxury market. \u201cWe have to be very clear here,\u201d he told me, leaning back on his black chaise longue. \u201cLuxury business is coming either from Paris, or it\u2019s coming from Italy, and watches are coming from Switzerland. They\u2019re not coming from the U.S.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSilicon Valley \u2014 my God, what they\u2019re wearing and everything! They really don\u2019t have this culture of refinement. We bring something else to the story.\u201d</p><p><strong>A\u2009traditional watch</strong> with hidden electronics is one solution to the smartwatch challenge. Montblanc, the European luxury-goods brand, has another, more unusual idea.</p><p>When I visited Alexander Schmiedt, who runs the company\u2019s watch business, in the village of Villeret, he handed me a smartwatch prototype. The actual timepiece is entirely mechanical, from Montblanc\u2019s \u201cTimeWalker\u201d line of watches. It contains no circuitry.</p><p>Instead, the computerized parts are in the wristband. This \u201ce-Strap\u201d features a small rubber module that sits on the wrist\u2019s underside. The module has an inch-and-a-half touch-screen, where white text and images alert the wearer to incoming calls, SMS messages, emails and social-media messages. The screen can only display 16 characters at a time, so reading a message means swiping back and forth across it. Internal activity sensors track and send data to your phone. (The module I saw was a nonworking mock-up.) Watch and e-Strap together will sell for roughly $5,000.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to put the technology inside the watch,\u201d Schmiedt said as he strapped on the TimeWalker, a handsome brushed-stainless-steel body whose black-and-red face was encircled by a black ceramic ring. \u201cIt would mean that after a predetermined while, the watch itself would become outdated.\u201d</p><p>At Montblanc, he said, the engineers tell a story to illustrate the perils of high-tech obsolescence: At graduations in the 1990s, students receive gifts from their parents \u2014 some the latest mobile phone, others a Montblanc fountain pen. Decades later, a phone from the \u201990s is a useless relic. But the Montblanc pen is as good as ever; indeed, the years have imparted character. \u201cIt has a meaning, it has little scratches,\u201d Schmiedt said. \u201cIf I ever scratch up a watch, or \u2014 I don\u2019t know, my child maybe dropped it \u2014 it\u2019s a mark of life.\u201d Our electronics are much less tolerant of faults, he noted, grinning as he held up his own iPhone, whose screen was spider-webbed with cracks.</p>\n<p>Dividing the Montblanc smartwatch into two components may make it less intrusive, Schmiedt believes, because the e-Strap\u2019s screen usually faces away from the wearer. \u201cYou don\u2019t always have it in your sight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can choose when you want to see it.\u201d The OLED screen preserves battery life, too. Montblanc promises five days before the device needs charging.</p>\n<p>Schmiedt is enthusiastic about the e-Strap, of course. But looking at this Janus device \u2014 analog and digital faces on opposing sides \u2014 I couldn\u2019t help thinking that it would be harder for Montblanc to strike a balance between smartwatch and mechanical device than for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant or Mondaine. The latter are younger companies, and Mondaine primarily sells affordable quartz watches. Montblanc, however, is trying to safeguard a much older brand name: In 2007, it bought Minerva, a storied Swiss watchmaker founded in 1858. Famous for producing deeply complex movements beloved by collectors, Minerva foundered during the quartz crisis. When Schmiedt walked into the Minerva factory for the first time, it had a mere 20 workers, fashioning watches using century-old tools.</p><p>\u201cYou had really this living heritage, like a sleeping beauty, as if the thing had been stopped in time,\u201d he told me.</p><p>When I visited that factory, it was alive with quiet, careful activity. In one room, a line of expert watchmakers polished individual pieces. One man in a white coat was hunched over an elongated figure eight of stainless steel, which he would spend a week shaping; next to him, a woman used a 40x magnification microscope and color-coded emery boards to etch 45-degree beveled edges into a half-inch-long \u201cbridge.\u201d Across the room sat a master watchmaker with tattoos down his left arm and on his elbow. His job was to assemble the watch and ensure it worked, then to disassemble it, recleaning and reoiling the parts before putting it back together one final time. On the wall was pinned one of the oldest types of technology in the building: the dried stalk of a local flower. It\u2019s used, I was told, to polish brass parts to a luminous glow.</p><p><strong>At Basel this year,</strong> Edouard Meylan, chief executive of the high-end watchmaker H. Moser, issued a news release claiming that he, too, would be introducing a smartwatch. But at the Basel fair, he displayed a traditional mechanical timepiece \u2014 a \u201cperpetual calendar\u201d with bold dials and a meter showing how much energy the spring has left in it. In a promotional video, H. Moser called it \u201cthe original smartwatch,\u201d joking that even \u201cour grandmother could use it.\u201d The message was clear: Watches are already smart.</p><p>When I spoke to Meylan, he was even more direct. Making smartwatches is a mistake, he argued, particularly for elite brands. To be sure, he said \u2014 as many of his peers did \u2014 the Apple Watch will probably be successful. \u201cWith the right battery, eventually it\u2019ll become something very useful that I will probably wear myself,\u201d he said. But he considers putting smartwatch technology inside a mechanical Swiss timepiece to be brand suicide. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a gimmick,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially in our range.\u201d His company, like Montblanc and Ateliers deMonaco, sells watches that cost tens of thousands of dollars. They shouldn\u2019t be creating \u201csome kind of monsters that are a merger of a mobile phone and an actually beautiful mechanical watch.\u201d</p><p>Once a timepiece becomes a computer, what should it <em>not</em> do? Should there be limits? Does watchness become only a trivial part of a smartwatch\u2019s function? \u201cThat\u2019s a little bit the scary thing,\u201d says Pim Koeslag of his work at Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant. \u201cOnce you get into it, you see that this is only the beginning of the beginning.\u201d There\u2019s no GPS in his smartwatch now, but he could imagine putting it in. \u201cYou could put in cameras or weather stations or whatever. The only limit is imagination.\u201d</p><p>TAG Heuer is one high-end brand that plans to produce what Silicon Valley might recognize as a smartwatch: a digital version of the TAG Heuer Carrera. TAG Heuer\u2019s engineers will design the physical case, but everything else will come from technology partners. Intel will make the touch screen and the electronics; Google will provide Android Wear software. The goal is to release something by the end of this year that can compete with Apple on the apps front while also being unmistakably Swiss.</p><p>\u201cAt two meters distance, you will not know, \u2018Is this guy wearing a TAG Heuer Carrera connected or is this guy wearing a chronograph Carrera normal?\u2019\u2009\u201d said Biver, the chief executive of TAG Heuer, when I visited his office in Nyon. \u201cThat will give us the watchmaking appeal, which the computer guys at Apple, Samsung don\u2019t have.\u201d</p>\n<p>Biver is a famously voluble, opinionated figure, prone to grand statements and poetic riffs on the beauty of timepieces. He wears, and occasionally caresses, a chunky watch from Hublot (another luxury brand that he oversees). He says the design of the Apple Watch is \u201cnot very sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is not enough emotion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a reduction of the phone for the wrist.\u201d</p><p>Yet it\u2019s fair to ask how \u201cSwiss\u201d his prospective watch will really be. As several observers told me, it\u2019s just as much an Intel-and-Google watch. \u201cWhere is your value-add?\u201d asks Amy Glasmeier, an M.I.T. professor who has written about the watch industry. Swiss watchmakers, she adds, will need to create their own high-tech intellectual property in smartwatches. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat they\u2019ve got is just the use of their name. It\u2019s not the use of their human capital.\u201d Raffaelli, the Harvard professor, is a bit more sanguine. He says that the Swiss watchmakers may promote their preindustrial history, but they\u2019ve long been experts at innovating. All those mechanical features \u2014 perpetual calendars, self-winding mechanisms \u2014 were the transformative high tech of their day. The clock itself was a first step toward the \u201cquantified self,\u201d making visible information that was previously hidden, your precise progress through the day.</p>\n<p>Even if the Swiss smartwatch never takes off, many of the watch executives I spoke with said that the Apple Watch might be good for sales of high-end mechanical watches. Why? Because a generation of Americans has grown up without the habit of wearing a watch. Apple is now spending millions to convince younger consumers \u2014 those who coordinate their lives not by looking at a wristwatch, but with \u201cI\u2019m on my way!\u201d text messages and shared Google Calendar events \u2014 that a watch can be useful and fashionable again. \u201cMany young people who would never wear something on their wrist, they will start wearing something on their wrist, which is the connected watch,\u201d Biver said. Having acquired the habit of glancing down, maybe they\u2019ll eventually decide they want to look at an older sort of device instead \u2014 a machine that, in a sense, is outside time.</p><footer>\n    <div>\n                <em><div><p>Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of \u201cSmarter Than You Think.\u201d He last wrote for the magazine about how <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/magazine/can-video-games-fend-off-mental-decline.html\">video games could help the aging mind</a>.</p></div></em>\n        <div><p><em>Sign up for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/magazine/\">our newsletter</a> to get the best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week.</em></p></div>\n\n        \n        <em><p>A version of this article appears in print on June 7, 2015, on page MM28 of the <span>Sunday Magazine</span> with the headline: Face-Off. \n</p></em>\n    </div>\n    </footer>\n        \n    </div>\n    <div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n    \n    <div>\n        <div>\n    \n</div>\n<div>\n    \n</div>\n<div>\n    <aside>\n</aside>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <aside>\n</aside>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <aside>\n</aside>\n</div>\n    </div>\n\n</article>\n\n\n\n\n                    \n            ", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/07/magazine/07watch1/07watch1-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg"}
