Sometimes there are basal thermometers and blood tests and injections and ultrasounds and <a href=\"https://medium.com/theli-st-medium/the-saddest-room-on-earth-cb2249250830\">many visits to the doctor</a>. Sometimes girl meets a bunch of different boys and none of them quite take. Sometimes girl says, fuck it, I\u2019ll do it on my own.</p><p>And sometimes, at 41, after lots of great relationships and some less-great relationships and optimistic plans to explore fertility treatments, girl gets unexpectedly knocked up.</p><p>That\u2019s what happened to me. I had a lovely summer romance, and got pregnant. The relationship ended, the pregnancy did not. And so, here I am\u200a\u2014\u200a41, single and pregnant. Woohoo, I have it all!</p><p>I\u2019m now in my second trimester and luckily, all is well so far. I\u2019ve started telling friends. They\u2019ve started telling friends. And I\u2019ve realized just how many non-traditional parents I know.</p><p>There\u2019s the friend who has been jumping through the complex hoops of surrogacy across three states and counting. There\u2019s the friend who ordered up a sperm donor and happily did it on her own.</p><p>There\u2019s the friend who is carrying her wife\u2019s fertilized egg, and the friend whose job it was to inject her wife with donor sperm.</p><p>There\u2019s the single friend who took advantage of her company\u2019s corporate egg-freezing benefit because she\u2019s in her mid-30s and hopes to someday have kids, and the married friend who did it because she\u2019s in her mid-30s and isn\u2019t sure yet. There are the friends with kids in their 20s, 30s, and IVF-assisted 40s. There are the friends who adopt, and there are the friends who don\u2019t want kids at all.</p><p>(I also have friends who met, married, and reproduced. They\u2019re great, too.)</p><p>All this, as it turns out, is not unusual. Certainly not single mothers, whose birth rates have been <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/03/25/same-sex-marriage-does-not-threaten-birth-rates-or-child-rearing/\">increasing steadily for decades</a>, particularly <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acs-21.pdf\">over the past decade</a>. They account for <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/09/30/352661280/marriage-pattern-shifts-seen-by-some-as-destabilizing-society\">over half of first births</a> in the United States and approximately <a href=\"https://singlemotherguide.com/single-mother-statistics/#identifier_0_13\">40% of all newborns</a>.</p><p>Not older mothers, since both the average age for <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/05/06/the-new-demography-of-american-motherhood/\">childbirth</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/09/30/352661280/marriage-pattern-shifts-seen-by-some-as-destabilizing-society?utm_source=tumblr.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_content=20140930\">marriage</a> is increasing. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr62/nvsr62_09.pdf\">According to the CDC</a>, in 2012, the birthrate decreased for women in their 20s but increased for women aged 30-44, and the average age of a woman at her first birth increased. We know <a href=\"http://www.babycenter.com/0_age-and-fertility-getting-pregnant-in-your-40s_1494699.bc\">fertility declines as a woman ages</a>, but thanks to evolving technologies, later pregnancies are <a href=\"http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/pregnancy-rates-rise-for-women-over-40/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\">much more common</a>. (I am officially what is called a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/high-risk-pregnancy/art-20047012\">high-risk pregnancy</a>\u201d but at my doctor\u2019s office no one seems to find me that remarkable, which is immensely comforting.) Not everyone who tries later in life will be able to get pregnant. But the <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/health/6-ways-to-boost-your-odds-of-ivf-success-96727458312.html\">trends</a> are <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2598140/IVF-treatment-single-women-DOUBLES-search-Mr-Right-instead.html\">showing</a> that more women will try, and more of those tries will have a better chance of success.</p><p>(Three points on technology feeding into this trend: (1) demand for reproductive technologies is clearly on the rise; (2) at this point it is <a href=\"http://www.gayivf.com/family-building-for-gay-men/financial-considerations.cfm\">quite expensive</a>; (3) both those things should incentivize entry into the marketplace, which will increase access and, eventually, bring down costs. There\u2019s no denying that right now, fertility options are really only options for the affluent.)</p><p>The cost of pursuing fertility treatments was my biggest obstacle last year as I tried to figure out the best course of action. Obamacare doesn\u2019t explicitly cover it, though <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/health/pregnancy/2013/10/reproductive_services_under_obamacare_5_things_you_should_know.html\">some states do so electively</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.resolve.org/get-involved/the-center-for-infertility-justice/public-policy/the-affordable-care-act-and-infertility.html\">selectively</a>. Once a woman starts, taking time off work to undergo those treatments can be <a href=\"http://ced.blr.com/2008/07/family-and-medical-leave-can-an-employee-use-intermittent-fmla-leave-for-fertility-treatments/#\">complicated</a>. Then, if God willing it all works out, there\u2019s the whole issue of what happens after the baby is born. If you don\u2019t have a great employer with a great maternity plan, taking time off from work <a href=\"http://the-toast.net/2014/10/27/employer-put-fml-fmla/\">can also be challenging</a>. As an expectant mom who is currently self-employed, I\u2019m amazed at just how tied to the workplace maternity benefits are. And then, of course, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherhood_penalty#cite_note-BudigEngland-1\">there\u2019s the motherhood penalty</a>. The New Normal, such as it is, is definitely not without its bumps and bruises\u200a\u2014\u200aon the one hand, there are the affluent parents who can, at least, afford all this, and on the other there are the 12 million <a href=\"https://singlemotherguide.com/single-mother-statistics/#identifier_0_13\">single-parent families</a> in the U.S., 80% of which are led by single mothers.</p><p>I\u2019m lucky\u200a\u2014\u200aall this is happening for me during a moment of unprecedented transparency around parenthood, fertility and the rainbow of possible options therefor. Odds are I won\u2019t be the only single woman in my eventual birthing class (and if I am, one of my best girlfriends volunteered to come with me to help me figure out how to breathe and when to push). And while I can\u2019t click on a pregnancy-related link or open a pregnancy book without being informed of what my assumed \u201cpartner\u201d should be doing, I also recognize that they are out of date, not me. (Never mind that the default pronoun there is usually \u201che.\u201d Time for some new editions, publishers!)</p><p>But even acknowledging my luck\u200a\u2014\u200ato get pregnant the old-fashioned way, to get pregnant at all\u200a\u2014\u200adoesn\u2019t mean everything is going to be perfect. That\u2019s one of the biggest flaws in the so-called \u2018debate\u2019 over fertility options, like the <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119945/freak-out-over-birth-control\">recent kerfuffle</a> over companies offering coverage for egg-freezing\u200a\u2014\u200athese are options, but no one said they were perfect options. But what is? Even a dewily-youthful zygote conceived inside a loving marriage has no guarantees, since 10\u201320% of known pregnancies <a href=\"http://www.babycenter.com/0_understanding-miscarriage_252.bc#articlesection1\">end in miscarriage</a> (and that stat is <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pregnancy-loss-miscarriage/basics/definition/con-20033827\">probably higher</a> owing to the incidence of miscarriage very early on, before a woman might know she was pregnant).</p><p>This <a href=\"https://medium.com/theli-st-medium/in-due-time-60055938267b\">emphasis on pregnancy perfection</a> has led to a bizarre cone of silence around fertility challenges. It\u2019s amazing that something common to so many women is shrouded in so much shame. There has until very recently been no real space for women to talk about experiencing <a href=\"http://modernloss.com/giving-voice-to-the-silent-sorrow/\">miscarriage</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/theli-st-medium/the-saddest-room-on-earth-cb2249250830\">IVF</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/theli-st-medium/rainy-with-a-chance-of-baby-infertility-ivf-and-cancer-71f05c72f780\">infertility</a>. Egg-freezing is still kept mum (and women are still <a href=\"http://time.com/3509930/company-paid-egg-freezing-will-be-the-great-equalizer/\">reluctant to go on the record</a> about it). And despite every newly-married couple being asked, \u201cSo, when are you having kids?\u201d it\u2019s still unusual for women to share that they\u2019re trying, at least outside their closest circle.</p><p>For single women, admitting that you want kids when you\u2019re still unattached can feel like exposing a vulnerability. It did to me. If someone said, \u201cDon\u2019t you want kids?\u201d (when you hit a certain age, it\u2019s usually framed like that). I\u2019d say yes, but I would deflect more questions. I certainly didn\u2019t share that I sometimes lay down on my bed and sobbed to realize that I was 40 years old and had probably missed the boat.</p><p>Now that I am pregnant\u200a\u2014\u200aand showing\u200a\u2014\u200amy body is a tell. There have been and will be perfectly innocent reactions, like \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were seeing someone!\u201d (I\u2019m not) and \u201cIs the father involved?\u201d (he\u2019s not). It\u2019s fine\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m happy to be where I am and do not want what I haven\u2019t got. (Random Sinead O\u2019Connor reference, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Do_Not_Want_What_I_Haven%27t_Got\">check</a>.)</p><p>What I do want is to be transparent about where I am and how I got here. I don\u2019t like the cone of silence\u200a\u2014\u200ait didn\u2019t do me any favors in my 20s or 30s, and I don\u2019t see it doing much for other women, either. In 2014, I see that changing, and I want to be part of it. We\u2019re having a coming out moment about fertility, and, like the miracle sperm that somehow managed to fertilize my forty-something eggs, it\u2019s just in time. In 2014, having children is complicated and daunting and fraught\u200a\u2014\u200aas much as it\u2019s always been, but now we\u2019re talking about it. And the more we talk about it, the more of us will realize that we\u2019re not going through it alone. Far from it.</p><p>I\u2019m 41, single, and pregnant.
