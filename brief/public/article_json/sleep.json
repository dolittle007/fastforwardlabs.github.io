And the next, and the next, until I was regularly entering the forgotten, ancient tunnel to the other side of midnight: segmented sleep. It looked embarrassing in a modern context, but it was once the most normal thing in the world.</p><p>Back when segmented sleep was common, this period between \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201csecond\u201d sleep inspired reverence. The French called it <em>dorveille</em>, or wakesleep, a hypnotic state. English speakers called it \u201cthe watch.\u201d I had usually approached the post-\u00admidnight hours full-sail, by staying up. Waking into them is different, childlike. The time feels freer. The urge to be busy abates. Conversation has a conspiratorial intimacy, as if you\u2019ve sneaked behind the tent to find the only other smoker at the wedding. Though I preferred the name <em>dorveille</em>, because it sounded glamorous, \u201cthe watch\u201d was technically more accurate during those early weeks, when I mainly got up and watched Netflix.</p><p>In the preindustrial West, most people slept in two discrete blocks and used <em>dorveille</em> for all kinds of purposes. Having sex was popular. Benjamin Franklin liked to \u201ctake cold-air baths,\u201d a fancy way of saying \u201copen his windows naked.\u201d Many people wrote in journals or interpreted dreams, which feel more proximate at 3 a.m. than in daylight. You could drink a cup of tea and take a satisfied leak on the embers of your fire. But everyone did something, because <em>dorveille</em> was ubiquitous.</p>\n<p>We tend to view our basic patterns, like spending the evening out and then lying unconscious for eight hours straight, as belonging to a natural order. But until streetlights, being up late meant wandering town in butt-\u00adclenching terror, tripping over stray animals until the wind blew out your lantern and you were set upon by armed bandits. So you went home before dark and went to bed early, waking after midnight. Much of this was forgotten until 2001, when the historian Roger Ekirch unearthed segmented sleep in the cultural history of pre-\u00ad19th-\u00adcentury Europe, supporting the research of an American chronobiologist who, in a 1992 study, asserted that segmented sleep is more natural than the monophasic variety we now aspire to. Exposed over several weeks to preindustrial light conditions, most of us will gradually start sleeping twice a night, hooked to the Ur-\u00adrhythm of our internal clock.</p>\n<p>It was the Industrial Revolution, saturating us with electric light, that caused <em>dorveille</em> to obsolesce \u2014 but now it\u2019s electricity that makes it so useful. <em>Dorveille</em> is the only part of the day when no one expects to hear from anyone at all. You can keep yourself unavailable without that abstract sense of guilt. You never need to open an email. <em>Dorveille\u2019s</em> appeal doesn\u2019t derive from historicity: what appeals is the escape from the very conditions that obliterated it.</p><p>At first, I treated <em>dorveille</em> like stolen time, and like most thieves, I was careless with my loot, frittering it away each night. But as I persisted, I saw the deeper value. <em>Dorveille</em> once served as a time to remember dreams. For me, the tasks undertaken in <em>dorveille</em> retained a little of the ease of dreaming. During the day, I can\u2019t reliably read 20 pages in a row before I experience an overwhelming physical urge to waste my time. During <em>dorveille,</em> I finished books. It was like having a superpower. Nor must <em>dorveille</em> be all business. I found that snaggly, insoluble problems, in friendships and writing and marriage, were more easily confronted and could be muddled through for longer.</p><p>Metabolically, the alertness of <em>dorveille</em> differs from the taut insomniac variety. The author of that 1992 study \u2014 the one that proved the innateness of segmented sleep \u2014 described <em>dorveille</em> as a state of \u201cnonanxious wakefulness,\u201d which truly sounds oxymoronic until you experience it. I\u2019m one of the least relaxed people I know; having lived most of my adult life in New York, \u201cawake\u201d and \u201canxious\u201d are synonyms as far as I\u2019m concerned. But during these hours I felt calm. Most amazing, I had no desire to reach for my phone. I felt an unfamiliar lack of itch.</p>\n<p>It is sometimes noted that segmented sleep fits snugly within the Christian Liturgy of the Hours, which obligated the faithful to rise at dawn for Lauds and pray in the dead of night. This isn\u2019t the whole story (pre- and non-\u00adChristian cultures practiced biphasic sleep), but what is true is that <em>dorveille</em> was communal. Waking at 2 a.m. in 1550, you were not quite alone. Your husband or wife was up, too. Your neighbors were up, you might reasonably think, probably doing the same things you were. An invisible clamor of writing, drinking, lovemaking, fighting humanity enveloped you. That\u2019s the part of segmented sleep I might never experience. I get the postmodern afterglow, the decay of a mass-\u00adcultural behavior into an individual preference. I\u2019ve gained another routine, when what I want is a sense of ritual.</p><footer>\n    <div>\n                <em><div><p>Jesse Barron is a writer in New York.</p></div></em>\n        <div><p><em>Sign up for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/magazine\">our newsletter</a> to get the best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week.</em></p></div>\n\n        \n        <em><p>A version of this article appears in print on April 3, 2016, on page MM26 of the <span>Sunday Magazine</span> with the headline: Segmented Sleep. \n</p></em>\n    </div>\n    </footer>\n        \n    </div>\n    <div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n    \n    <div>\n        <div>\n    \n</div>\n<div>\n    <aside>\n</aside>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <aside>\n</aside>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <aside>\n</aside>\n</div>\n    </div>\n\n</article>\n\n\n\n                    \n            ", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/03/magazine/03lor/03mag-03lor-t_CA0-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
