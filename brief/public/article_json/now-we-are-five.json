She was living in a room in a beat-up house on the hard side of Somerville, Massachusetts, and had been dead, the coroner guessed, for at least five days before her door was battered down. I was given the news over a white courtesy phone while at the Dallas airport. Then, because my plane to Baton Rouge was boarding and I wasn\u2019t sure what else to do, I got on it. The following morning, I boarded another plane, this one to Atlanta, and the day after that I flew to Nashville, thinking all the while about my ever-shrinking family. A person expects his parents to die. But a sibling? I felt I\u2019d lost the identity I\u2019d enjoyed since 1968, when my younger brother was born.</p> <p>\u201cSix kids!\u201d people would say. \u201cHow do your poor folks manage?\u201d</p> <p>There were a lot of big families in the neighborhood I grew up in. Every other house was a fiefdom, so I never gave it much thought until I became an adult, and my friends started having children. One or two seemed reasonable, but anything beyond that struck me as outrageous. A couple Hugh and I knew in Normandy would occasionally come to dinner with their wrecking crew of three, and when they\u2019d leave, several hours later, every last part of me would feel violated.</p> <p>Take those kids, double them, and subtract the cable TV: that\u2019s what my parents had to deal with. Now, though, there weren\u2019t six, only five. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t really say, \u2018There <em>used</em> to be six,\u2019 \u201d I told my sister Lisa. \u201cIt just makes people uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p>I recalled a father and son I\u2019d met in California a few years back. \u201cSo are there other children?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cThere are,\u201d the man said. \u201cThree who are living and a daughter, Chloe, who died before she was born, eighteen years ago.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not fair, I remember thinking. Because, I mean, what\u2019s a person supposed to do with <em>that</em>?</p> <p>Compared with most forty-nine-year-olds, or even most forty-nine-<em>month-</em>olds, Tiffany didn\u2019t have much. She did leave a will, though. In it, she decreed that we, her family, could not have her body or attend her memorial service.</p> <p>\u201cSo put <em>that</em> in your pipe and smoke it,\u201d our mother would have said.</p> <p>A few days after getting the news, my sister Amy drove to Somerville with a friend and collected two boxes of things from Tiffany\u2019s room: family photographs, many of which had been ripped into pieces, comment cards from a neighborhood grocery store, notebooks, receipts. The bed, a mattress on the floor, had been taken away and a large industrial fan had been set up. Amy snapped some pictures while she was there, and, individually and in groups, those of us left studied them for clues: a paper plate on a dresser that had several drawers missing, a phone number written on a wall, a collection of mop handles, each one a different color, arranged like cattails in a barrel painted green.</p> <p>Six months before our sister killed herself, I made plans for us all to gather at a beach house on Emerald Isle, off the coast of North Carolina. My family used to vacation there every summer, but after my mother died we stopped going, not because we lost interest but because it was she who always made the arrangements and, more important, paid for it. The place I found with the help of my sister-in-law, Kathy, had six bedrooms and a small swimming pool. Our weeklong rental period began on Saturday, June 8th, and we arrived to find a delivery woman standing in the driveway with seven pounds of seafood, a sympathy gift sent by friends. \u201cThey\u2019s slaw in there, too,\u201d she said, handing over the bags.</p> <p>In the past, when my family rented a cottage my sisters and I would crowd the door like puppies around a food dish. Our father would unlock it, and we\u2019d tear through the house claiming rooms. I always picked the biggest one facing the ocean, and, just as I\u2019d start to unpack, my parents would enter and tell me that this was <em>theirs</em>. \u201cI mean, just who the hell do you think you are?\u201d my father would ask. He and my mother would move in, and I would get booted to what was called \u201cthe maid\u2019s room.\u201d It was always on the ground level, a kind of dank shed next to where the car was parked. There was never an interior stairway leading to the upper floor. Instead, I had to take the outside steps and, more often than not, knock on the locked front door, like a beggar hoping to be invited in.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do <em>you</em> want?\u201d my sisters would ask.</p> <p>\u201cI want to come inside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d Lisa, the eldest, would say to the others, who were gathered like disciples around her. \u201cDid you hear something, a little whining sound? What is it that makes a noise like that? A hermit crab? A little sea slug?\u201d Normally, there was a social divide between the three eldest and the three youngest children in my family. Lisa, Gretchen, and I treated the others like servants and did very well for ourselves. At the beach, though, all bets were off, and it was just upstairs against downstairs, meaning everyone against me.</p> <p>This time, because I was paying, I got to choose the best room. Amy moved in next door, and my brother, Paul, his wife, and their ten-year-old daughter, Maddy, took the spot next to her. That was it for oceanfront. The others arrived later and had to take the leftovers. Lisa\u2019s room faced the street, as did my father\u2019s. Gretchen\u2019s faced the street and was intended for someone who was paralyzed. Hanging from the ceiling were electric pulleys designed to lift a harnessed body into and out of bed.</p> <p>Unlike the cottages of our youth, this one did not have a maid\u2019s room. It was too new and fancy for that, as were the homes that surrounded it. Traditionally, all the island houses were on stilts, but more and more often now the ground floors are filled in. They all have beachy names and are painted beachy colors, but most of those built after Hurricane Fran hit the coast, in 1996, are three stories tall and look almost suburban. This place was vast and airy. The kitchen table sat twelve, and there was not one but <em>two</em> dishwashers. All the pictures were ocean-related: seascapes and lighthouses, all with the airborne \u201cV\u201ds that are shorthand for seagull. A sampler on the living-room wall read, \u201cOld Shellers Never Die, They Simply Conch Out.\u201d On the round clock beside it, the numbers lay in an indecipherable heap, as if they\u2019d come unglued. Just above them were printed the words \u201cWho cares?\u201d</p> <p>This was what we found ourselves saying whenever anyone asked the time.</p> <p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d</p> <p>The day before we arrived at the beach, Tiffany\u2019s obituary ran in the Raleigh <em>News &amp; Observer</em>. It was submitted by Gretchen, who stated that our sister had passed away peacefully at her home. This made it sound as if she were very old, and had a house. But what else could you do? People were leaving responses on the paper\u2019s Web site, and one fellow wrote that Tiffany used to come into the video store where he worked in Somerville. When his glasses broke, she offered him a pair she had found while foraging for art supplies in somebody\u2019s trash can. He said that she also gave him a <em>Playboy</em> magazine from the nineteen-sixties that included a photo spread titled \u201cThe Ass Menagerie.\u201d</p> <p>This was fascinating, as we didn\u2019t really know our sister very well. Each of us had pulled away from the family at some point in our lives\u2014we\u2019d had to in order to forge our own identities, to go from being <em>a</em> Sedaris to being our own specific Sedaris. Tiffany, though, stayed away. She might promise to come home for Christmas, but at the last minute there\u2019d always be some excuse: she missed her plane, she had to work. The same would happen with our summer vacations. \u201cThe rest of us managed to make it,\u201d I\u2019d say, aware of how old and guilt-trippy I sounded.</p> <p>All of us would be disappointed, though for different reasons. Even if you weren\u2019t getting along with Tiffany at the time, you couldn\u2019t deny the show she put on\u2014the dramatic entrances, the non-stop, professional-grade insults, the chaos she\u2019d inevitably leave in her wake. One day she\u2019d throw a dish at you and the next she\u2019d create a stunning mosaic made of the shards. When allegiances with one brother or sister flamed out, she\u2019d take up with someone else. At no time did she get along with everybody, but there was always someone she was in contact with. Toward the end, it was Lisa, but before that we\u2019d all had our turn.</p> <p>The last time she joined us on Emerald Isle was in 1986. \u201cAnd, even then, she left after three days,\u201d Gretchen reminded us.</p> <p>As kids, we spent our beach time swimming. Then we became teenagers and devoted ourselves to tanning. There\u2019s a certain kind of talk that takes place when you\u2019re lying, dazed, in the sun, and I\u2019ve always been partial to it. On the first afternoon of our most recent trip, we laid out one of the bedspreads we had as children, and arranged ourselves side by side on it, trading stories about Tiffany.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the Halloween she spent on that Army base?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the time she showed up at Dad\u2019s birthday party with a black eye?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI remember this girl she met years ago at a party,\u201d I began, when my turn came. \u201cShe\u2019d been talking about facial scars, and how terrible it would be to have one, so Tiffany said, \u2018I have a little scar on my face and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so awful.\u2019</p> <p>\u201c \u2018Well,\u2019 the girl said, \u2018you would if you were pretty.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>Amy laughed and rolled over onto her stomach. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good line!\u201d</p> <p>I rearranged the towel I was using as a pillow. \u201cIsn\u2019t it, though?\u201d Coming from someone else, the story might have been upsetting, but not being pretty was never one of Tiffany\u2019s problems, especially when she was in her twenties and thirties, and men tumbled helpless before her.</p> <p>\u201cFunny,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t remember a scar on her face.\u201d</p> <p>I stayed in the sun too long that day and got a burn on my forehead. That was basically it for me and the beach blanket. I made brief appearances for the rest of the week, stopping to dry off after a swim, but mainly I spent my days on a bike, cycling up and down the coast, and thinking about what had happened. While the rest of us seem to get along effortlessly, with Tiffany it always felt like work. She and I usually made up after arguing, but our last fight took it out of me, and at the time of her death we hadn\u2019t spoken in eight years. During that period, I regularly found myself near Somerville, and though I\u2019d always toy with the idea of contacting her and spending a few hours together, I never did, despite my father\u2019s encouragement. Meanwhile, I\u2019d get reports from him and Lisa: Tiffany had lost her apartment, had gone on disability, had moved into a room found for her by a social-service agency. Perhaps she was more forthcoming with her friends, but her family got things only in bits and pieces. She didn\u2019t talk <em>with</em> us so much as <em>at</em> us, great blocks of speech that were by turns funny, astute, and so contradictory it was hard to connect the sentence you were hearing to the one that preceded it. Before we stopped speaking, I could always tell when she was on the phone. I\u2019d walk into the house and hear Hugh say, \u201cUh-huh . . . uh-huh . . . uh-huh . . .\u201d</p> <p>In addition to the two boxes that Amy had filled in Somerville, she also brought down our sister\u2019s ninth-grade yearbook, from 1978. Among the messages inscribed by her classmates was the following, written by someone who had drawn a marijuana leaf beside her name:</p> <blockquote><p>Tiffany. You are a one-of-a-kind girl so stay that way you unique ass. I\u2019m only sorry we couldn\u2019t have partied more together. This school sux to hell. Stay</p> <p>-cool</p> <p>-stoned</p> <p>-drunk</p> <p>-fucked up</p> <p>Check your ass later.</p></blockquote> <p>Then, there\u2019s:</p> <blockquote><p>Tiffany</p> <p>I\u2019m looking forward to getting high with you this summer.</p> <p> </p> <p>Tiffany,</p> <p>Call me sometime this summer and we\u2019ll go out and get blitzed.</p></blockquote> <p>A few weeks after these messages were written, Tiffany ran away, and was subsequently sent to a disciplinary institution in Maine called \u00c9lan. According to what she told us later, it was a horrible place. She returned home in 1980, having spent two years there, and from that point on none of us can recall a conversation in which she did not mention it. She blamed the family for sending her off, but we, her siblings, had nothing to do with it. Paul, for instance, was ten when she left. I was twenty-one. For a year, I sent her monthly letters. Then she wrote and asked me to stop. As for my parents, there were only so many times they could apologize. \u201cWe had other kids,\u201d they said in their defense. \u201cYou think we could let the world stop on account of any one of you?\u201d</p> <p>We were at the beach for three days before Lisa and our father, who is now ninety, joined us. Being on the island meant missing the spinning classes he takes in Raleigh, so I found a fitness center not far from the rental cottage, and every afternoon he and I would spend some time there. On the way over, we\u2019d talk to each other, but as soon as we mounted our stationary bikes we\u2019d each retreat into our own thoughts. It was a small place, not very lively. A mute television oversaw the room, tuned to the Weather Channel and reminding us that there\u2019s always a catastrophe somewhere or other, always someone flooded from his home, or running for his life from a funnel-shaped cloud. Toward the end of the week, I came upon my father in Amy\u2019s room, sifting through the photographs that Tiffany had destroyed. In his hand was a fragment of my mother\u2019s head with a patch of blue sky behind her. Under what circumstances had this been ripped up? I wondered. It seemed such a melodramatic gesture, like throwing a glass against a wall. Something someone in a movie would do.</p> <p>\u201cJust awful,\u201d my father whispered. \u201cA person\u2019s life reduced to one lousy box.\u201d</p> <p>I put my hand on his shoulder. \u201cActually, there are two of them.\u201d</p> <p>He corrected himself. \u201cTwo lousy boxes.\u201d</p> <p>One afternoon on Emerald Isle, we all rode to the Food Lion for groceries. I was in the produce department, looking at red onions, when my brother sneaked up from behind and let loose with a loud \u201c<em>Achoo</em>,\u201d this while whipping a bouquet of wet parsley through the air. I felt the spray on the back of my neck and froze, thinking that a very sick stranger had just sneezed on me. It\u2019s a neat trick, but he also doused the Indian woman who was standing to my left. She was wearing a blood-colored sari, and so she got it on her bare arm as well as her neck and the lower part of her back.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, man,\u201d Paul said when she turned around, horrified. \u201cI was just playing a joke on my brother.\u201d</p> <p>The woman had many thin bracelets on, and they jangled as she brushed her hand against the back of her head.</p> <p>\u201cYou called her \u2018man,\u2019 \u201d I said to him after she walked off.</p> <p>\u201cFor real?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Amy mimicked him perfectly. \u201cFor real?\u201d</p> <p>Over the phone, my brother, like me, is often mistaken for a woman. As we continued shopping, he told us that his van had recently broken down, and that when he called for a tow truck the dispatcher said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be right out, sweetie.\u201d He lowered a watermelon into the cart, and turned to his daughter: \u201cMaddy\u2019s got a daddy who talks like a lady, but she don\u2019t care, do she?\u201d</p> <p>Giggling, she punched him in the stomach, and I was struck by how comfortable the two of them are with each other. Our father was a figure of authority, while Paul is more of a playmate.</p> <p>When we went to the beach as children, on or about the fourth day our father would say, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to buy a cottage down here?\u201d We\u2019d get our hopes up, and then he would bring practical concerns into it. They weren\u2019t petty\u2014buying a house that will eventually get blown away by a hurricane probably isn\u2019t the best way to spend your money\u2014but still we wanted one desperately. I told myself when I was young that one day <em>I</em> would buy a beach house and that it would be everyone\u2019s, as long as they followed my Draconian rules and never stopped thanking me for it. Thus it was that on Wednesday morning, midway through our vacation, Hugh and I contacted a real-estate agent named Phyllis, who took us around to look at available properties. On Friday afternoon, we made an offer on an oceanfront cottage not far from the one we were renting, and before sunset our bid was accepted. I made the announcement at the dinner table and got the reaction I had expected.</p> <p>\u201cNow, wait a minute,\u201d my father said. \u201cYou need to think clearly here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI already have,\u201d I told him.</p> <p>\u201cO.K., then, how old is the roof? How many times has it been replaced in the last ten years?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen can we move in?\u201d Gretchen asked.</p> <p>Lisa wanted to know if she could bring her dogs, and Amy asked what the house was named.</p> <p>\u201cRight now it\u2019s called Fantastic Place,\u201d I told her, \u201cbut we\u2019re going to change it.\u201d I used to think the ideal name for a beach house was the Ship Shape. Now, though, I had a better idea. \u201cWe\u2019re going to call it the Sea Section.\u201d</p> <p>My father put down his hamburger. \u201cOh, no, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s perfect,\u201d I argued. \u201cThe name\u2019s supposed to be beachy, and, if it\u2019s a pun, all the better.\u201d</p> <p>I brought up a cottage we\u2019d seen earlier in the day called Dune Our Thing, and my father winced. \u201cHow about naming it Tiffany?\u201d he said.</p> <p>Our silence translated to: Let\u2019s pretend we didn\u2019t hear that.</p> <p>He picked his hamburger back up. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea. The perfect way to pay our respects.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, we could name it after Mom,\u201d I told him. \u201cOr half after Tiffany and half after Mom. But it\u2019s a house, not a tombstone, and it wouldn\u2019t fit in with the names of the other houses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, baloney,\u201d my father said. \u201cFitting in\u2014that\u2019s not who we are. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re about.\u201d</p> <p>Paul interrupted to nominate the Conch Sucker.</p> <p>Amy\u2019s suggestion had the word \u201cseaman\u201d in it, and Gretchen\u2019s was even dirtier.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the name it already has?\u201d Lisa asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d my father said, forgetting, I think, that this wasn\u2019t his decision. A few days later, after the buyer\u2019s remorse had kicked in, I\u2019d wonder if I hadn\u2019t bought the house as a way of saying, See, it\u2019s just that easy. No hemming and hawing. No asking to look at the septic tank. Rather, you make your family happy and iron out the details later.</p> <p>The cottage we bought is two stories tall and was built in 1978. It\u2019s on proper stilts and has two rear decks, one above the other, overlooking the ocean. It was rented to vacationers until late September, but Phyllis allowed us to drop by and show it to the family the following morning, after we checked out of the house we\u2019d been staying in. A place always looks different\u2014worse, most often\u2014after you\u2019ve made the commitment to buy it, so while the others raced up and down the stairs, claiming their future bedrooms, I held my nose to a vent and caught a whiff of mildew. The sale included the furniture, so I also made an inventory of the Barcaloungers and the massive TVs that I would eventually be getting rid of, along with the shell-patterned bedspreads and cushions with anchors on them. \u201cFor our beach house, I want to have a train theme,\u201d I announced. \u201cTrains on the curtains, trains on the towels\u2014we\u2019re going to go all out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d my father moaned.</p> <p>We sketched a plan to return for Thanksgiving, and, after saying goodbye to one another, my family splintered into groups and headed off to our respective homes. There had been a breeze at the beach house, but once we left the island the air grew still. As the heat intensified, so did the general feeling of depression. Throughout the sixties and seventies, the road back to Raleigh took us past Smithfield, and a billboard on the outskirts of town that read, \u201cWelcome to Klan Country.\u201d This time, we took a different route, one my brother recommended. Hugh drove, and my father sat beside him. I slumped down in the back seat, next to Amy, and every time I raised my head I\u2019d see the same soybean field or low-slung cinder-block building we\u2019d seemingly passed twenty minutes earlier.</p> <p>We\u2019d been on the road for a little more than an hour when we stopped at a farmers\u2019 market. Inside an open-air pavilion, a woman offered complimentary plates of hummus served with a corn-and-black-bean salad, so we each accepted one and took seats on a bench. Twenty years earlier, the most a place like this might have offered was fried okra. Now there was organic coffee, and artisanal goat cheese. Above our heads hung a sign that read, \u201cWhispering Dove Ranch,\u201d and just as I thought that we might be anywhere I noticed that the music piped through the speakers was Christian\u2014the new kind, which says that Jesus is awesome.</p> <p>Hugh brought my father a plastic cup of water. \u201cYou O.K., Lou?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d my father answered.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you think she did it?\u201d I asked as we stepped back into the sunlight. For that\u2019s all any of us were thinking, <em>had been</em> thinking since we got the news. Mustn\u2019t Tiffany have hoped that whatever pills she\u2019d taken wouldn\u2019t be strong enough, and that her failed attempt would lead her back into our fold? How could anyone purposefully leave us, <em>us</em>, of all people? This is how I thought of it, for though I\u2019ve often lost faith in myself, I\u2019ve never lost it in my family, in my certainty that we are fundamentally better than everyone else. It\u2019s an archaic belief, one that I haven\u2019t seriously reconsidered since my late teens, but still I hold it. Ours is the only club I\u2019d ever wanted to be a member of, so I couldn\u2019t imagine quitting. Backing off for a year or two was understandable, but to want out so badly that you\u2019d take your own life?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that it had anything to do with us,\u201d my father said. But how could it have not? Doesn\u2019t the blood of every suicide splash back on our faces?</p> <p>At the far end of the parking lot was a stand selling reptiles. In giant tanks were two pythons, each as big around as a fire hose. The heat seemed to suit them, and I watched as they raised their heads, testing the screened ceilings. Beside the snakes was a low pen corralling an alligator with its mouth banded shut. It wasn\u2019t full grown, but perhaps an adolescent, around three feet long, and grumpy-looking. A girl had stuck her arm through the wire and was stroking the thing\u2019s back, while it glared, seething. \u201cI\u2019d like to buy everything here just so I could kill it,\u201d I said.</p> <p>My father mopped his forehead with Kleenex. \u201cI\u2019m with you, brother.\u201d</p> <p>When we were young and set off for the beach, I\u2019d look out the window at all the landmarks we drove by\u2014the Purina silo on the south side of Raleigh, the Klan billboard\u2014knowing that when we passed them a week later I\u2019d be miserable. Our vacation over, now there\u2019d be nothing to live for until Christmas. My life is much fuller than it was back then, yet this return felt no different. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I asked Amy.</p> <p>And instead of saying, \u201cWho cares?,\u201d she said, \u201cYou tell me. You\u2019re the one with a watch on.\u201d</p> <p>At the airport a few hours later, I picked sand from my pockets, and thought of our final moments at the beach house I\u2019d bought. I was on the front porch with Phyllis, who had just locked the door, and we turned to see the others in the driveway below us. \u201cSo is that one of your sisters?\u201d she asked, pointing to Gretchen.</p> <p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd so are the two women standing on either side of her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve got your brother,\u201d she observed. \u201cThat makes five\u2014wow! Now, <em>that\u2019s</em> a big family.\u201d</p> <p>I looked at the sunbaked cars we would soon be climbing into, furnaces every one of them, and said, \u201cYes. It certainly is.\u201d <span>\u2666</span></p> <section><p><em>Sign up for the daily newsletter.</em><em>Sign up for the daily newsletter: the best of The New Yorker every day.</em></p>  \t<div>      \t        </div></section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "thumbnail": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/131028_r24150-1200-630-18171504.jpg"}
