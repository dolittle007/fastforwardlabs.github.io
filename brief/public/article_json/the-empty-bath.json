At the end of Book 10 the Greek heroes Diomedes and Odysseus go into the sea to wash off the sweat they have worked up during a night mission in which they have slaughtered a dozen Thracians and captured their horses. Then they \u2018climbed into polished bathtubs and bathed themselves\u2019. The Greeks (or Achaians as Homer calls them) have been camping out on the shore near Troy for nine years, so it\u2019s conceivable that they had equipped their huts with a full Nestorian en suite. Or maybe they packed portable baths in their hollow ships as they set off for Troy, on the principle that for a long siege you would need a lot of kit including if not the kitchen sink then at least the bath. Alternatively the presence of these bathtubs may be a sign that the free-standing episode related in Book 10 (traditionally called the \u2018Doloneia\u2019) was, as most scholars now believe, composed by someone other than \u2018Homer\u2019, who was a bit more prone to nod than the writer he emulated. But the magically appearing bathtubs at the end of Book 10 are a marker of a very deep-seated feature of Homeric poetry. Objects can be conjured out of the air by a set of rules for narrative plausibility which are not ours. Diomedes and Odysseus are rich and powerful. They are exhausted and they have been successful. Rich and powerful warriors have baths, so the bathtubs have to be there and must be \u2018polished\u2019. The way Homeric narrative deals with objects is determined not by probability or the laws of physics, but by social ambience, and by what a poet thinks an audience is likely to expect.</p><p>Another bathtub figures towards the end of the poem, when the Trojan hero Hector (as I will call him: Peter Green believes we should eradicate the familiar Roman equivalents for Homer\u2019s names, so he calls him Hekt\u014dr) has been killed by Achilles (and, phew, Green calls him Achilles rather than Akhilleus: two cheers for inconsistency). Hector\u2019s wife, Andromache, calls her maids to heat water for \u2018a hot bath for Hekt\u014dr when he came home from the fighting \u2013/unaware, in her folly, that far from all baths he\u2019d been slain\u2019. Inside the walls of Troy there is no problem about the presence of baths or any other amenity: it is a well-built domestic space where there is weaving and warm linen. The problem with this particular bathtub is that the hero who is supposed to collapse into it to wash off the day\u2019s fighting can never do so. Hector is dead. The empty bath is a reminder of the way war abuts and busts up domestic life.</p><p>Recent English poetic responses to the <em>Iliad</em> have tended to emphasise its violence. Alice Oswald\u2019s <em>Memorial</em> (2011) makes the poem a string of elegies for the dead interspersed with similes, and pares away almost all narrative elements. Christopher Logue\u2019s dazzling paraphrases adopt a fragmentary form which appears to have been broken apart by the violence it represents, which is often grotesque (\u2018His neck was cut clean through/Except for a skein of flesh off which/His head hung down like a melon\u2019). Both of these versions are powerful re-imaginings of the <em>Iliad</em> from which anyone, whether they can read the original or not, can learn. But both Oswald and Logue risk turning Homer\u2019s socially subtle and carefully constructed narrative into a Poundian snuff movie, a poem in which one violent and vivid image of death succeeds another. Homer\u2019s baths show how important domesticity is to his poem, but they also illustrate two other features of the <em>Iliad</em> that have got rather lost in contemporary poetic reactions to it. The <em>Iliad</em> is a poem of surprises \u2013 mostly nasty, when death rips into domestic life and a bath is left to cool as a wife grieves. It is also magical in a particular way. It creates rhythms of expectation around objects and events, and then varies those rhythms with extraordinary emotional skill. In the process strange things can happen to both people and objects.</p><p>This can be illustrated if we backtrack from Hector\u2019s missed bath to the fighting that precedes his death, and follow the progress of one of the key implements of death in the poem: spears. Achilles has finally been drawn back into the battle with the Trojans after Hector has killed the gentle Patroclus. He throws his \u2018far-shadowing spear\u2019, so \u2018massive and strong, that no other Achaian fighter/could wield\u2019 it, at the Trojan Aeneas:</p><blockquote><p>Aineias, crouching down, held his shield out away from him<br>in terror: the flung spear passed over his shoulder, stuck<br>in the ground, after breaking through both layers<br>of the sheltering shield.</p></blockquote><p>This moment of Marvel Comic heroism prompts a footnote from Green, who describes it as a \u2018physical improbability that suggests this passage may be the work of an interpolator\u2019. Moments later Poseidon interrupts the battle in order to save Aeneas by shot-putting him right out of the fray, which some might argue is more of a physical improbability than a spear ripping through a shield. The god doesn\u2019t want Achilles to be disadvantaged too much, however, so he pulls \u2018his well-bronzed ash-wood spear/out from the shield of great-hearted Aineias, and set[s] it/at the feet of Achilles\u2019. This is the spear which we were told only moments before had passed right through Aeneas\u2019 shield and stuck in the ground. Where did the spear actually end up? Was it locked by convention into the shield of its adversary, or did it pass with a unique energy right through it? In the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it the single spear seems to bilocate, and then a god obligingly returns it to its owner, because on a battlefield once you have thrown your spear you\u2019re effectively left with three options: close combat, death or divine intervention.</p><p>A little later the singularity of heroes\u2019 spears is again an issue, this time a tragic one. Achilles \u2018let fly his far-shadowing spear\u2019 at Hector during their final combat. He misses and it sticks in the ground. Athene helpfully fetches it back. But Hector is not so lucky: he too \u2018let fly his far-shadowing spear\u2019. It bounces off Achilles\u2019 shield. Hector calls for another from De\u00efphobos, but his mortal friend is \u2018nowhere near at hand\u2019. Hector then knows he\u2019s had it. So do readers of the poem. The repetition of the phrase \u2018let fly his far-shadowing spear\u2019 highlights the asymmetry between the two heroes and anticipates what happens next. The son of Thetis has a god to help him. Hector, by contrast, can\u2019t even find a mortal friend. He is in the nightmare that precedes death:</p><blockquote><p>As in a dream one can\u2019t overtake the quarry one\u2019s chasing \u2013<br>the fugitive can\u2019t get away, nor his pursuer catch him \u2013<br>so Achilles could not catch up, nor Hekt\u014dr get clear away \u2026</p></blockquote><p>What this spear-play reveals is something central to Homer, and to many of the arguments about Homer which have raged over the past two centuries. It used to be held, chiefly by 19th-century German scholars, that the received text of the <em>Iliad</em> includes a number of interpolations by later hands. This would explain why Achilles\u2019 spear can be simultaneously stuck in the ground and in Aeneas\u2019 shield: a dopey interpolator messed up. The next orthodoxy had it that \u2018Homer\u2019 was really a tradition of oral formulaic poets, and if strange things happen it is probably because the poet was on oral formulaic autopilot (spears \u2013 well, they stick in shields or in the ground and sometimes you forget which you\u2019ve said happened). More recent scholars, including Green in his wise and learned introduction to his translation, argue that the <em>Iliad</em> was composed probably by a single person sometime between 800 and 650 <span>bc</span>. The poem was grounded in a complex oral tradition which had grown up in the centuries after the Mycenaean bronze age, but which refashioned that tradition on a scale and with a sophistication that probably depended on writing. It may then have been augmented in various ways.</p><p>*</p><p><span>Whether</span> this thesis is true or not, it does allow us to see some of the poem\u2019s more curious moments as the product of art rather than accident, or of art happily co-operating with accident. Oral formulae and conventional scenes are not simply recombined in order to chunter out yet another combat: they are used to generate a set of expectations, which are then varied to create surprise and horror. A bath is prepared for a warrior, because warriors bathe after victory. But this warrior does not come back. A far-shadowing spear is thrown. A god intervenes. Another far-shadowing spear is thrown. A god does not intervene. A mortal dies. Things happen repeatedly, then suddenly they differ. That rhythm of action, which combines repetition with asymmetry, is the rhythm of Homeric narrative and of the Homeric style. And it is designed to hold you in its spell as much as the rhythm of a line: the beat of repetition tells you this must happen, then, behold a wonder, it does not. The moments when (perhaps) lines or episodes have been added to the poem, or when material inconsistencies occur, shouldn\u2019t simply be regarded as boluses of inauthenticity. They are, for a reader of the received text (which would include every epic poet in the Western tradition), part of the magic. This is a world in which spears can sometimes be in two places at once.</p><p>The rhythm of expectation and surprise which runs through the <em>Iliad</em> interacts in curious ways with the larger principles that appear to underly the poem. Homer is sometimes said to have believed in something called fate. Like the belief that the poem is all about black blood bursting forth before warriors bite the ground this is at best a partial truth. Homer\u2019s gods have motives, and human favourites, and an overall sense of what the larger outcomes of the combat will be. They can sometimes pitch a favourite out of the battlefield or hide them in a cloud, but they don\u2019t pull human destinies about like puppet masters, and sometimes they have to let their own offspring die. Their interventions in human affairs often go wrong. \u2018Fate\u2019 in the <em>Iliad</em> can sometimes mean more or less \u2018if you pursue this option rather than that, then some day soon you will die,\u2019 as when Achilles chooses a short life with glory rather than a long life of ease by returning to the battlefield. The choice limits his life options, but it doesn\u2019t book him in for the morgue on 24 November. Human beings also appear to be able to predict some things that are going to happen. In Book 6 Andromache urges Hector not to fight. It\u2019s the most moving episode in the whole poem, which again forces a conjunction between a domestic world within and the fighting outside the walls of Troy. Andromache gives her husband the option of staying by the wild fig tree to fight a rearguard campaign. But Hector says he must \u2018win great glory both for my father and myself\u2019, and then imagines Andromache\u2019s future:</p><blockquote><p>For this I know well, in my heart and in my mind:<br>A day will come when sacred Ilion will perish,<br>with Priam, lord of the fine ash spear, and Priam\u2019s people.<br>Yet it\u2019s not the Trojans\u2019 coming miseries that so concern me \u2013<br>not what Hekab\u0113 will endure, or our sovereign Priam,<br>or my brothers, so many, so valiant, who all may end up<br>trodden into the dust by their hate-filled enemies \u2013 no,<br>it\u2019s your grief I think of, when some bronze-corsleted Achaian<br>will lead you away, weeping, your day of freedom gone,<br>to work the loom, maybe in Argos, for some other mistress,<br>or fetch water back from the spring \u2013 Messe\u00efs or Hyperia \u2013<br>resentful, unwilling, but burdened by harsh necessity.</p></blockquote><p>Is Hector foreseeing a fixed destiny and just heroically deciding to live it through to death? Is the \u2018necessity\u2019 he talks of just the male force that will compel Andromache to labour in Argos, or does it imply a larger metaphysical drive? He is, however, not simply displaying his sister Cassandra\u2019s gift of prophecy. He says Andromache could be enslaved in \u2018Messe\u00efs <em>or</em> Hyperia\u2019, and in the Greek he uses a mixture of the subjunctive and the optative to describe her future (Green\u2019s \u2018will lead you away\u2019 could be rendered as \u2018may lead you away\u2019). He seems to think of her fate as a cluster of the kinds of thing that could happen to her given that Troy will fall, rather than as a certain future that precludes all other possibilities.</p><p>Hector\u2019s speech is further complicated by the fact that, two books before, the Greek leader Agamemnon had uttered very similar words when his brother Menelaus (for whose wife, Helen, the whole war is fought) was wounded:</p><blockquote><p>A day will come when sacred Ilion will perish,<br>with Priam, lord of the fine ash spear, and Priam\u2019s people;<br>And Zeus, high-throned son of Kronos, the sky dweller,<br>will, in fury at such deceit, shake his black-cloud aegis<br>over them all. These matters will not fail of fulfilment.<br>But dreadful sorrow for you will be mine, Menela\u00f6s my brother,<br>if you die now, and fulfil your lifetime\u2019s destiny;<br>and a contemptible creature I\u2019d be, back in thirsty Argos,<br>for at once the Achaians\u2019 minds will turn to their native land,<br>and we\u2019d be leaving the Trojans and Priam a cause for boasting<br>in Argive Helen!</p></blockquote><p>Agamemnon gets a great deal wrong in the poem. Early on he confiscates Achilles\u2019 war-prize, the slave-girl Briseis, and provokes Achilles\u2019 withdrawal from battle. He can also misjudge the mood of his troops. His certainty that Ilion (Troy) will fall is matched by uncertainty about whether his brother will die, and whether, consequentially, Troy will not in fact fall. How much of his uncertainty carries across to Hector\u2019s speech to his wife, which shares two lines with Agamemnon\u2019s, and similarly incorporates variability into the future it imagines? If Agamemnon is wrong about Menelaus\u2019 future might not Hector be wrong about Andromache\u2019s? How much do any mortals know about what will happen to them? The <em>Iliad</em> leaves these questions open. Time has its rhythms, its repeated certainties, but it also has its surprises. Both sides know Troy will fall, but the how and the when and who it takes with it are not certain.</p><p>*</p><p><span>In</span> \u2018On Translating Homer\u2019 Matthew Arnold described Homer as \u2018eminently noble\u2019, \u2018eminently rapid\u2019 and \u2018eminently plain and direct\u2019 in style and ideas. Homer \u2018has, besides, the pure lines of an Ionian horizon, the liquid clearness of an Ionian sky\u2019. These assertions are often quoted. I find that strange because they seem plain crazy to me. They are a projection of what Arnold wanted to believe. He wanted to see heroic primitiveness in Homer, and he wanted to import a Hellenic directness to English poetry. In order to achieve these ends (and to enable him to take potshots at Victorian translators) he made Homer sound solid, uncomplex and ethically consistent. Homer is not any of these things. There is an immense moral seriousness to the <em>Iliad</em>: it conveys \u2013 as Jasper Griffin brilliantly showed three decades ago in <em>Homer on Life and Death</em> \u2013 the contrast between the darkness of death and the fragile joy of living. But the poem can also be whimsical, magical, ironical and circuitous. Above all it is repeatedly surprising.</p><p>This is particularly true of relationships between Zeus and men, which, because the king of the gods is too lofty to set foot on the battlefield, are conducted by intermediaries. Here, too, things don\u2019t always turn out as they should. Generally, if Zeus has something to say to a mortal or a god he says it to Iris, the goddess of the rainbow. Iris then usually goes and says exactly the same words to the recipient of the message, like a mini-version of the zombie oral formulaic poet Homer is sometimes supposed to be. And usually (it being aegis-bearing Zeus talking) people obey. An \u2018eminently plain and direct\u2019 poet would make everybody always do what Zeus says, and would make Zeus always say what he means. But Homer isn\u2019t a plain and direct poet. Repetition tends to bring variation, and can unleash a whole set of unpredictable reactions. Sometimes Iris slips in postscripts of her own, as when she adds to Zeus\u2019 message to Athene, or \u2018Miss Grey-Eyes\u2019 (Green has fun with the vocative use of Homeric epithets): \u2018you\u2019re a real horror, you shameless bitch, if you truly/dare to lift up your prodigious spear against Zeus.\u2019</p><p>Elsewhere Zeus is perverse and oblique. In Book 2 he sends a dream to Agamemnon, and tells the dream to \u2018Bid him to arm the long-haired Achaians for battle/as quickly as may be, for now he may take the broad-streeted city/of the Trojans.\u2019 Zeus doesn\u2019t actually mean what his dream says. He has been primed by Achilles\u2019 mother, Thetis, to hurt the Greeks in revenge for the way that Agamemnon has treated her son. In order not to annoy his wife, Hera, too much (she is hostile to the Trojans because Paris preferred Aphrodite to her), Zeus goes about achieving this aim like a politician. So he sends Agamemnon a message which isn\u2019t true and which will lead to the deaths of many Achaians. The misleading message is repeated twice. The dream (disguised as ancient Nestor) repeats it to Agamemnon. Agamemnon repeats it to the Achaian leaders. But then he calls a council of the entire army. At this council we might expect Zeus\u2019 words to be repeated a final time, but they are not. Agamemnon makes a fine speech to the assembled army telling them that it\u2019s time to pack up and go home. He does so to test their morale, and presumably in the hope that his proposal that they should chuck it all in will make them buckle on their brazen armour for a final assault. But they \u2018with loud hullabaloo\u2019 run off to pack their ships for the journey home. Hera then tells Athene to tell Odysseus to tell the Greeks to stop running away, which he does. So they do eventually fight. Human wishes trickle up obliquely to the gods \u2013 Thetis asks Zeus a favour for her mortal son \u2013 and then are executed in unpredictable ways by false messages that lead to perverse actions. Does this circuitous process of misinformation display the \u2018liquid clearness of an Ionian sky\u2019? My arse it does. This is a densely political world in which everyone is telling a slightly different story, and in which by a series of nudges the overall arc of a narrative is finally generated out of a series of insubordinate episodes. Lying dreams issue in lies which issue, ultimately, in slaughter.</p><p>There can be an Arnoldian directness to Homeric combat (a warrior vaunts, unleashes a far-shadowing spear, an opponent crashes to the ground skewered through the liver) but the key note of most of the political and social encounters depicted in the poem is anything but direct: deep interpersonal wariness prevails and the unwary get played, even if they are the king of the gods. When Hera washes herself with ambrosia and ties \u2018a sash with a hundred tassels\u2019 around her waist and comes over all coochy-coo with Zeus, he ought to be experienced enough to notice that she\u2019s distracting his attention so that Poseidon can help the Achaians below, but she is ambrosia from head to foot, and Zeus (as he tactlessly reminds her) has form when it comes to the ladies. The king of Troy, Priam, is wiser in this respect. In the terrifying final book of the poem he goes by night to ask Achilles to return Hector\u2019s body. He encounters the god Hermes (in disguise), who has been sent by Zeus to conduct him on his way. Priam isn\u2019t sure if Hermes is an enemy, but with a mule train of rich gifts for Achilles behind him he can\u2019t take any risks. Hermes asks Priam where he is going. Priam doesn\u2019t say, but tries to nudge Hermes into revealing who he is by flattering him with \u2018your parents are truly blessed.\u2019 When Hermes deflects the implied question, Priam asks again: \u2018Who are you, most noble sir, and who, pray, are your parents?\u2019 King Priam has lived a long time. He has worked out that even if a god has prompted you to go to your mortal enemy\u2019s dwelling by night you don\u2019t assume that everyone you meet along the way will be a friend, or that you will arrive. Events unfold crabwise, and your unexpected death or betrayal might be part of that unfolding. You need to work out just who you are talking to and deal with them slyly if you don\u2019t want to end up as a nasty mess on the battlefield.</p><p>The very last episode of the poem, in which Priam supplicates Achilles (who has killed so many of his sons) for the return of Hector\u2019s body, is fraught with the danger that the rhythm of the poem (in which so many unexpected things occur) has created. Tros supplicated Achilles on the battlefield. He was killed. Lykaon supplicated Achilles on the battlefield. He was killed. And now Priam is supplicating Achilles, having slipped by night to his hut. What will be the outcome? We know that a god has told Priam to go, and we know that a god has told Achilles to grant his request. But we also know that the gods don\u2019t always say what they mean and that people don\u2019t always obey the gods, and that Achilles can do things that are completely outside the norms of human behaviour. All that danger and strangeness is encapsulated in the great simile with which Homer evokes Achilles\u2019 wonder when he sees Priam embracing his knees and kissing \u2018those terrible murderous hands, that had killed so many of his sons\u2019:</p><blockquote><p>As when blind delusion possesses a man to murder<br>someone in his own country, and he flees to an alien people,<br>to some wealthy man\u2019s house, and wonder grips those who see him \u2013<br>so Achilles was amazed at the sight of godlike Priam.</p></blockquote><p>This is the biggest of all the jolts Homer gives to his audience\u2019s expectations. Suddenly Priam, in the house of a killer, is compared to a killer seeking refuge. And by beginning the simile with the blind delusion that prompts someone to kill (Green, here as always, is scrupulous to follow the sequence of the Greek), Homer doesn\u2019t instantly discharge the tension. Is blind delusion going to spread to Achilles, and make him kill another suppliant? This final scene is so powerful not because it tidily presents a moral (Achilles, having become inhumanly violent in his rage at the death of Patroclus, accepts his mortal nature, decides to reassume humanity and return the body he has abused to its father), but because it is fringed with other possible worlds, in which Priam is killed, or Priam is betrayed and ransomed. Those obliquely suggested other worlds are everywhere in the <em>Iliad</em>. They make it a magical poem not in the sense of a fairyland of wishes fulfilled, or of massive soldiers hurling stones it would take three men today to lift, but in the sense of presenting human events as perilously engineered and surrounded by fear \u2013 the terror of possible death, of things going wrong, of Troy not falling because Menelaus succumbs to a flesh wound and the allies give up the aim of winning Helen back. It presents living as one possibility among myriad possibilities, most of which are fatal.</p><p>One of the sensible things Arnold said about Homer was that a translation should \u2018reproduce on the intelligent scholar, as nearly as possible, the general effect of Homer\u2019. Setting aside the smug fiction (or is it an oxymoron?) of the \u2018intelligent scholar\u2019, this is a demanding but desirable goal for translators. It is a goal which, in respect of the <em>Iliad\u2019s</em> narrative if not always of its poetic texture, Peter Green achieves. His main virtue, which is impossible to illustrate by selective quotation, is that he always makes it clear exactly what is happening in the poem and why. There are a few moments when some readers might reach for a dictionary to translate the translation (hands up who could identify a \u2018barley groat\u2019 or a \u2018thole pin\u2019 or who could draw a \u2018gleaming baldric\u2019). Once or twice he nods: his description of a lion struck in the chest as it leaps \u2018and thus it\u2019s its own courage that destroys it\u2019 sounds like a mnemonic for distinguishing \u2018its\u2019 from \u2018it\u2019s\u2019 rather than a line of Homer. But taken as a whole this is the best line-for-line translation of the poem I know. Green also provides a detailed plot summary and a glossary of places and people, which combines wry and perceptive observations about Homer\u2019s characters with a mass of lightly worn historical scholarship. He is very much a historian, and describes the <em>Iliad</em> as \u2018a wonderful compendium of cultural evidence from all periods of its evolution\u2019, as though it were a versified archaeological site, layering civilised layer on Mycenaean foundations, rather than a poem so full of wonders and surprises that it more or less had to generate wave on wave of poetic and critical responses. But his historical knowledge and his desire to get things right only very occasionally weigh the poem down. Most of the time they result in a translation that is accurate without being pedantic, and vivid without being aggressively contemporary.</p> </div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n12/contents\">Vol. 37 No. 12 \u00b7 18 June 2015</a> \u00bb <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/colin-burrow\">Colin Burrow</a> \u00bb <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n12/colin-burrow/the-empty-bath\">The Empty Bath</a><br>\npages 5-8 | 4565 words</p>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.lrb.co.uk/assets/covers/q/cov3712.jpg?1447470799"}
