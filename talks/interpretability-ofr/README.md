Clone, open index.html locally, then hit `p` on your keyboard to toggle
presenter notes, `c` to "clone" the window, `f` for full screen.

If given in full without rushing, this is a long talk! You will need to cut it
based on your audience and how long you have.

For a non-technical audience I suggest considering...

 - removing the white-box model
 - simplifying the second look at the prototype
 - cutting the _reasons_ for the interpretability-accuracy trade-off
 - cutting the stuff about applying LIME to unstructured data

For a conference audience (where your goal is probably to encourage people to
learn more after the talk, rather than teach them), personally I'd drop the
same stuff as for a non-technical audience (but keep the unstructured LIME),
and deal with anything else in Q&A.
