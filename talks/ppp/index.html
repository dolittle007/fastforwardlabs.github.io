We recently looked into probabilistic programming. Here are some of the
highlights of that work.

class: middle

### Bayesian inference is great in theory...

 - Quantify risk
 - Insert institutional knowledge

### but it's slow if you're not careful.

### Being careful requires cleverness...
 
 - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with automatic differentiation and NUTS

### the cleverness is now ready to abstracted away 😎

This talk is about probabilistic programming. But before I introduce it, I'm
going to spend the first 1/2 of the talk explaining the problems probabilistic
programming solves. Here's the outline of that first bit.

Let's start with a story. I conduct this A/B test and get these results.

Clearly layout B is better.

![](img/naiveanswer.png)

???

In your head, your making this plot. If the cross is above the line, layout B
is better. If it's below the line, layout A is.

If I had a million visitors to both layouts then yes, very probably our
conclusion is correct.

But what if I had 25 visitors to layout A, and 20 visitors to layout B. Are you
confident that these results would generalize to the real world? And what if it
costs you $1m to deploy the change? Do you want to risk it?

This is the central problem of data analysis.

I don't care how big your data is. It's still bad.

It suffers from measurement error, and it's incomplete.

Any conclusions you derive from it are uncertain. A statement like "layout B is
best" is an unfinished sentence. It's missing the second half, which should be
a statement of how certain you are about that claim.

Bayesian inference takes your prior beliefs and updates them in the light of
the data you've collected, giving you a thing called a posterior distribution.

That posterior is a measure of your uncertainty.

---

class: center, middle, full-bleed

![](img/compareposteriors.png)

???

To answer the question is layout A or layout B better, we compare the two
posteriors.

What's the answer? Layout A or layout B? We can't say!

But if we apply Bayes's rule, as I did to draw this plot, what we can say is
precisely how likely it is that layout B is better than layout A: it's about
85% in this case.

So if it costs you hundreds of thousands of dollars to change your website,
you're probably not confident enough.

You don't only have the ability to say how likely possibility 1 is. You can say
how likely all the other possibilities are! In that way you can quantify risk.

This is the first huge advantage of this approach. We can assign probabilities
to all possible outcomes. If we don't like what we can see, we can run the
experiment for longer, until we're more confident. And if we can't run the
experiment for longer, we can decide how much to bet, now we know the odds.

That's the power of having the full probabilistic picture. The ability to
quantify exactly how likely every possibility is, is not just a slight
improvement. It opens up qualitatively new kinds of products.

## Use Bayesian inference

When you

 - need to **quantify the probability of all possibilities**, not just determine
   which is most likely
 - want to make use of **institutional knowledge**
 - want to do **online learning** (i.e., continually update your model as data
   arrives)
 - want to do **active learning** (i.e., gather more information until your
   predictions reach some threshold of confidence)
 - want to use data to **decide if a more complicated model is justified**
 - have several **heterogeneous datasets**
 - need to **explain your decisions** to customers or regulators
 - have **sparse data** with a shared or hierarchical structure

We skipped over pretty much all the mathematical details there. If you're
interested, you might enjoy my recent series of interactive videos for
O'Reilly.

They show you how to do the simplest possible thing to implement Bayesian
inference. You'll get a great understanding of what's going on.

The downside is, the code we write is slow.

### Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

 - Explores efficiently...

--

### with autodiff
 - ...differentiates automatically...

--

### and NUTS

 - ...and is idiot-proof 😎

???

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is the latest and greatest.

It's _much_ faster at finding the interesting, high probability bits of the
problem. It's practical even if there are thousands of parameters.

It does this it at a cost: it needs to know not just the probability of a given
choice of parameters, but also the rate of change of that probability.

That's the gradient. You get the gradient of a function by differentiating. If
you remember your calculus, you'll remember that this wasn't always an easy
thing to do, and it was rarely fun.

The solution is automatic differentiation.

What this approach allows, however, is for you to leave the calculus to the
computer. If you give it the function, it's able to efficiently and accurately
evaluate its derivative, or gradient.

That allows Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to explore the probability space
strategically, rather than at random as in rejection sampling, or semi-randomly
as in Metropolis Hastings.

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo was further improved a couple of years ago by NUTS (or
the No U-Turn Sampler). That makes it more _robust_, which is the nice way of
saying "idiot proof". 

Thanks to autodiff you no longer have to differentiate a function to use HMC. 

And thanks to NUTS, you no longer have to tune sensitive parameters to get it
to work.

This finally brings us to probabilistic programming, where the complexities and
challenges I described get abstracted away in a programming paradigm.

In these systems, industrial strength implementations of the latest and
greatest inference algorithms are baked in to the language as one-liners. This
is similar to the way a fiddly algorithm like back propagation is available in
deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow or Theano.

All that's left to do for the user of these systems is specify the model, i.e.
describe the random process that, for a given choice of parameters, generates
the observations.

For a problem like A/B testing that's very simple. There's an unknown
conversion probability, and each visitor converts with that probability.

For more complicated problems it can be trickier to specify the model.
Probabilistic programming languages make things easier by including fundamental
ideals like probability distributions and random variables as primitives of the
language.

Now at this point, if you're a certain age, say my age or up, you may be saying
this sounds a lot like BUGS (or WinBUGS). And yes, they were early
probabilistic programming systems.

But what's changed in the last 2 or so years with the arrival of Stan and pymc3
is that HMC is now widely available. And that means that internet-scale
problems are now tractable.

```C
/* define data */
data {
    int<lower=0> N;
    int<lower=0> N_features;
    matrix[N, N_features] X;
    int<lower=0,upper=1> repaid[N];
}

/* define the thing you want to know */
parameters {
    vector[N_features] p_coef;
}

/* declare how the data is related to the thing you want to know */
model {
    vector[N] p;
    p_coef ~ cauchy(0, 2.5);
    p = logit(X * p_coef);
    repaid ~ bernoulli(p);
}
```

What does working with these languages look like?

Well, here's almost the complete Stan listing for a product I'm going to show
you in a second that predicts loan repayment based on income, outstanding debt,
loan purpose, etc.

And yes, it's very short! This is a side-product of distributions and RVs being
primitives of the language.

This is one of the interactive products we built, that depends totally on the
power to quantify the probability of all possibilities. It models consumer
credit applications.

And this is another product we built that models the NYC real estate market.
Fundamentally it's a linear regression, but it allows you to answer two
questions that can only be answered with the full posterior distribution:

 - I have $x. What is the probability I will be able to afford a property in
   this location at this time in the future?
 - I want to have a y% chance of affording a property in this location. How
   much money do I need?

## Options

#### Stan

 - great for offline analysis 👍
 
 - but it's very awkward to productize

#### pymc3

 - algorithmically half a step behind (although that's much less true than it
   used to be)

 - much easier to build products with 😎

#### Others

 - Anglican
 - Edward
 - Figaro

???

Every time you change your stan model, you need to change your application code
too. They risk getting out of sync in ways that break things spectacularly or,
even worse, subtly.

Check out Anglican if you like Clojure and other LISPy languages, Edward if
you're also interested in deep learning, and Figaro if you like Scala.

It's not just academic purists and FFL working on this stuff.

Facebook released a probabilistic programming product last month!

Prophet is a Python and R application that uses Stan under the hood for general
purpose seasonal forecasting.
