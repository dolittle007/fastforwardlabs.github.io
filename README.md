# fastforwardlabs.github.io

This is where we keep static files (demos, talks, design resources). Feel free to add to it and to put an entry and link in `index.html` if you would like.

It's hosted on github pages so changes to master will be automatically deployed. Also keep in mind this is a publically viewable repo so everything is viewable publically.
